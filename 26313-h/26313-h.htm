<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>ESSENTIALS OF SUCCESS</h3>
</div>

<p>Columella, the much traveled
Spanish-Roman writer of the first
century A. D., said that for successful
farming three things are essential: knowledge,
capital and love for the calling. This
statement is just as true today as it was when
written 1900 years ago by this early writer
on European agriculture.</p>
<p>Every man who loves the calling and has
an ambition to become a successful farmer
should understand that no two of these
essentials are sufficient, but that all three
are necessary. Although this is so simple
as to be almost axiomatic, it is indeed surprising
how few people believe a knowledge
of farming is really essential to success.</p>
<p>America is strewn with cases of failure,
in farming, by men investing capital acquired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
in other business. In nine cases out
of ten failure has been due to lack of knowledge
of farming.</p>
<p>There is known to the writer an expert
mineralogist and metallurgist. On the subject
of coal and gold mining he can give
the most valuable information. His advice
is constantly sought on all such matters.
Instead of investing his money in mining,
on which he is a recognized authority, he
has invested it in a farm, about which he
knows next to nothing. He has not even
had the advantage of being raised on a farm,
since his father was a railroad man.</p>
<p>A mechanical engineer remarked that if
he had $25,000 he would invest it in a farm.
This man is supposed to be an expert in
business methods as applied to manufacturing
in general, and he is especially conversant
with the manufacture and trade in
automobiles. About all he has seen of
farming he has observed from the window
of a Pullman car or from the steering wheel
of an automobile. Instead of investing his
earnings in some manufacturing business,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
about which he has spent years of study
and in which he has had some training, he
would invest it in farming, of which he has
only the most rudimentary knowledge, if
only he had sufficient capital. As a matter
of fact, he is more in need of knowledge
than of capital.</p>
<p>Even farmers of experience do not always
realize the training required to succeed in
farming. A letter was received by the dean
of a certain agricultural college saying that
a graduate of another agricultural college
had taken one of the poorest farms in his
neighborhood and was raising better potatoes
than anyone else could raise. The letter
asked that information be sent by return
mail as to how this young man could be
beaten in raising potatoes. Of course the
answer had to be sent that while information
upon raising potatoes could easily be
supplied, although not in the limits of an
ordinary letter, the training in observation,
judgment and reasoning faculties essential
to meet the daily problems as they arise
could not be supplied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>There is no objection to men of other
vocations adopting farming as an avocation
if they can afford it. It is a rational form of
pleasure for wealthy people, and one in
which they can often be of great service.
This cannot be said of all forms of relaxation.
Wealthy men have been of special
service to the cause of agriculture by promoting
the breeding of improved live stock.
Men in other callings should clearly understand,
however, that if they have a farm
merely as a place to spend a week end, that
they may expect to find the financial returns
unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>To no one is there more significance in the
old school aphorism knowledge is power
than to the young man who is to become a
farmer. While it is not necessary to be
educated in schools in order to gain knowledge,
yet the schoolroom with all its limitations
is usually the most economical and
most efficient method of acquiring certain
forms of knowledge essential to every successful
man or woman. A farm-to-farm
canvass of a certain region of the state of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
New York discloses the fact that farmers
with college training are obtaining a higher
income from their farms than those whose
school days ended with high school. Similarly,
those who have finished the high
school are more prosperous financially than
those who never advanced beyond the
grades. The investigation showed, for
example, that with the farmers under
observation the high school education was
equivalent to $6,000 worth of 5% bonds.
Farming is an occupation requiring keen
observation, sound judgment and accurate
reasoning, all attributes which are strengthened
greatly by proper education. This is
so true that many men, perhaps most men,
are forty before they have grasped the
problems which the truly successful farmer
must solve.</p>
<p>A considerable part of the knowledge
essential to success in any pursuit is acquired
by actually working at the occupation, or,
as we say, by practical experience. Some
features of any occupation can be obtained
in no other way. A preliminary education
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
may, however, greatly reduce the time
necessary to acquire even this practical experience.
For example, a course in shop
work as taught in technical high schools and
colleges, requiring two hours a day for five
months, may shorten the time of apprenticeship
by one or more years, in acquiring the
trade of carpenter or iron worker. In the
same manner a course in butter making,
cheese making or floriculture, may shorten
the time required to obtain the necessary
practical details by ten months or even
more. Eventually, also, the man thus
trained will be the better man.</p>
<p>If the industrial activities of the world
be divided into farming, mining, manufacturing,
trade and transportation, it will be
noted at once that farming is the only one
which deals with living things. In fact, the
definition of agriculture, in its broadest
sense, is the economic production of living
things. The farmer is thus brought face to
face with some of the most difficult and intricate
problems with which the human race
has to grapple. It is this fact that makes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
farming, in some ways, the most uncertain as
well as the most fascinating occupation
known to man. The fact that the farmer
is dealing with living things puts his occupation
in a class by itself for a number of
reasons, one of which is germane to the subject
of this chapter.</p>
<p>In most occupations a larger part of the
knowledge necessary to success can be
acquired by doing than is the case in farming.
Locomotive engineers are trained for
their responsible duty while firing the
engine. The brakeman becomes a conductor
by assisting the latter. A bank cashier
is usually a promoted bank clerk. Each
obtained the knowledge essential to success
largely by oft-repeated performance.</p>
<p>While, of course, there is much the
farmer can learn only by experience, there
are many things essential to his success that
the mere performance of the necessary
farm operations will not teach him. Spreading
manure will never teach him that stable
manure should be supplemented with phosphoric
acid in order to get the best results.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
The growing of clover will not teach him
that mineral fertilizer may keep up the fertility
of the soil where clover grows luxuriantly
and occurs in the rotation at definite
intervals. Feeding cattle will not teach him
that a good ration for milch cows is one containing
one pound of digestible protein to
seven pounds of digestible carbohydrates,
provided it is palatable and, at least, two-thirds
of the total ration is digestible. Nor
will the feeding of such a ration teach the
farmer how to calculate the most economical
ration from feeding stuffs at current
prices. The cause of potato blight and the
methods of combating it cannot be learned
from the operation of planting and cultivating
potatoes.</p>
<p>These are only a few illustrations&mdash;they
might be multiplied indefinitely&mdash;to show
that farming is peculiar in that performance
of the daily duties does not give the
knowledge essential to success in the same
measure that it does in such occupations as
banking, trade and transportation. Yet,
curiously enough, while no man would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
undertake to run a locomotive engine or
perform the duties of cashier of a bank
without thorough training, there are many
who will undertake to farm without education
or knowledge of the business.</p>
<p>The young man who intends to become a
farmer should fully understand that if
farming is not a business worthy of a thoroughly
educated man, it is not a business
worthy of him; because every young man
is worthy of a thorough education, provided
he is a man of clean habits and good purposes.
Do not allow yourself to be persuaded
that you lack ability to acquire a
good education. All you require is opportunity,
determination and honesty of intention.</p>
<p>Farming is worthy, moreover, of the
most highly educated as well as the most
capable. If lack of means prevents a young
man from taking a four-years training in
agriculture, he will find a two years course
offered by many of the state agricultural
schools. While it is obviously impossible
to give in two years as much training as in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
four years, these two years courses contain
the more technical subjects and are usually
very thorough and efficient. No young
man, no matter how thorough his previous
training, need hesitate to pursue one of
them.</p>
<p>There are, however, young men who cannot
spare the time and expense of even two
years training. For such many state agricultural
colleges offer winter terms of eight
to twelve weeks. These courses are arranged
to allow the student to specialize along
some particular line. The better prepared
the man is who enters these winter courses
the more he will benefit by them. This
leads to the caution that such courses should
not be substituted for the education offered
in the public schools, but should only be
sought after all the opportunities for education
at home have been exhausted.</p>
<p>For the somewhat older young man who
is now farming and cannot leave his farm
or for the younger man as a preparation
for the short courses, one or more correspondence
courses will be found useful. Not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
all colleges conduct correspondence courses,
but fortunately those who do will accept
students from other states on equal terms.
There are many persons who will testify to
their helpfulness.</p>
<p>Every young farmer should have a carefully
selected library of standard books on
agriculture, not only for reading but for
reference. An instance of the value of a
standard book of reference came recently
to the attention of the writer. An educated
young farmer in Iowa paid $2.50 for a peck
of crimson clover seed which he sowed in
the spring in his oats. A reference to any
standard publication on forage crops costing
less than the peck of seed would have
disclosed to him the probable hopelessness
of success under the conditions named.</p>
<p>The books to include as well as to exclude
from a select list will depend upon the
previous training of the man making the
purchase, the character of the farming to be
pursued, and, to some extent, to the section
of the country where the farm is located.
Any bookseller can secure catalogs issued by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
firms making a specialty of publishing agricultural
books. For the average reader
these catalogs are sufficient to enable one to
make intelligent purchases.</p>
<p>Every farmer should take one or more
agricultural journals. At present journals
are published on every phase of agriculture
and many of them are of high character.
Publishers are always glad to send sample
copies free of charge. By examining these
copies intelligent selection may be made.</p>
<p>The writer of this book has had rather
unusual opportunity during more than a
quarter of a century of observing the influence
of education upon the success, financial
and otherwise, of those who engage in farming.
As the result of these observations he
wishes to urge every young man to allow no
one to persuade him that because he is to
be a farmer, he does not need a thorough
education. Remember that you have but
one life to live, and if you let the golden
opportunity pass, the mistake can never be
rectified. No man ever regretted that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
had too much education&mdash;thousands have
regretted the lack of it.</p>
<p>Every young man, no matter what his
occupation is to be, should receive some
school training, however little it may be,
every year until he reaches the age of majority.
Otherwise the age of majority should
be changed. In no occupation is this more
important than in farming, because the
operations involved in farming fail to develop
certain attributes necessary to the
largest success.</p>
<p>A man cannot have a mind too well
trained, although it is possible that he may
have too much undigested information. The
mental condition may not be unlike the
physical condition of the man who is burdened

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>MEANS OF ACQUIRING LAND</h3>
</div>

<p>Of the three essentials to successful farming&mdash;capital,
knowledge and love for
the calling&mdash;only the first can be obtained on
credit, and this only in part. Usually when
a man desires to buy a farm he must have,
at least, one-third of his desired investment
in cash. The amount to be invested will
include, not only the cost of the land, but
the cost of the necessary equipment of the
farm. The percentage of the total capital
which may be borrowed, however, will depend
on many circumstances and is usually
a matter of first importance. No man
should borrow more than a banker or other
reputable business man considers a safe investment.</p>
<p>Usually there is no better counselor as to
a safe investment than the local banker.
The banker should, and generally does,
stand in much the same relation to the
financial welfare of the community as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
physician to its physical, the minister to its
moral and spiritual welfare. The inexperienced
person, even if he does not need to
borrow money, would do well to consult
some responsible banker in the neighborhood
before making an investment in farm
lands.</p>
<p>The young man should, as early as possible
in life, open an account with the local
bank, not merely for the sake of the habit of
saving which this will encourage, but in
order to come into personal business relations
with the banker. Instead of concealing
from the bank his business operations,
he should seek the advice of his banker on
all important financial matters.</p>
<p>On an average, every farm changes hands
at least three times in a century. Every
farm, therefore, must be acquired by purchase,
inheritance or gift at more or less
irregular intervals. In the neighborhood
in which the author was born, there is not a
farm but has changed hands since he can
remember. In many cases the farm is now
in the possession of a son; in some instances
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
in that of a grandson of the owner as known
by the writer in his boyhood days. In this
particular community the acquirement of a
farm by a person not related to the former
owner has occurred in relatively few
instances.</p>
<p>As a rule, when the farm has been
acquired by a son, the latter has operated
the farm as tenant or partner for a period
previous to his ownership and during lifetime
of the father. In some instances the
son has boarded with the parents or the parents
with the son and his wife; or, in the
case of a daughter, with the daughter and
son-in-law.</p>
<p>Where there are several heirs, as is apt
to be the case, the son operating the farm is
required to purchase or rent the interest of
the other heirs, unless the farm is large
enough to be divided, which is less seldom
the case than is popularly supposed. Thus,
if there are 200 acres of land worth $50 an
acre, and five heirs, the young farmer may
inherit $2,000, and be required to assume
the remaining $8,000 as an obligation. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
may borrow this money at the bank, placing
a mortgage upon the farm, thus settling
with the other heirs at once. Or he may
pay the other heirs rent on their share of the
farm. In any case he will, if successful,
gradually cancel his obligation and become
owner of the farm. That no heir is willing
to assume this responsibility is the most
common reason for a farm changing from
one family to another, and the disruption of
community interests.</p>
<p>The customary, or normal, method of
acquiring land has been and still is a combination
of tenancy, inheritance and mortgage.
Without some tenant system and
without the farm mortgage, it would be
impossible for the average young man to
acquire a farm. That men are constantly
advancing from farm tenant to landowner
is shown by statistics giving the percentage
of tenants by ages. The majority of farmers
under 30 are renters. Most farmers over
45 are owners of farm land. Thus in
Illinois, in 1900, approximately 75% of the
farmers under 25 years of age rented their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
farms, while less than 20% of the farmers
over 55 years of age were tenants.</p>
<p>The question for the young man to consider
is not what effect the tenant system
has upon the welfare of the nation or what
political ills may be connected with farm
mortgages, but how to make use of these
necessary and beneficent agencies for the
acquirement of a farm. A system of tenancy
which leads to absent landlordism and a
permanent tenant class is thoroughly
vicious, while a practice which enables a
man to become, within a reasonable period,
a land-owning farmer is a thoroughly approvable
and, indeed, necessary method of
acquiring land.</p>
<p>As already indicated, most young men
will need in some form or other to employ
more capital than they possess when they
start farming. They must, therefore,
determine what is the best form of obtaining
the necessary capital, viz.: whether to
borrow the money on a farm mortgage, or
whether to use the capital someone else has
invested in a farm by paying him rent for it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
The conditions of tenancy in this country
are often not the most fortunate, yet the
young man of character may well find, for
a time, at least, it would be best for him to
rent a farm and invest his own capital in the
necessary machinery and live stock to conduct
it properly.</p>
<p>Much will depend on the character of the
arrangement which may be made. Usually
more favorable terms can be secured from
landlords owning large numbers of farms
than from the owner of one or two farms.
The large landowner is content with a
moderate income from each farm, because
in the aggregate his income is sufficient for
his needs, while the retired farmer who
must live off the proceeds of a single farm
is apt to drive a hard bargain and may not
be over particular concerning the maintenance
of said farm. The writer knows a
farmer who owns a good farm purchased
from the proceeds of a rented farm. He
continues to live on the rented farm and
rents his own, because, it is said, his landlord
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
is willing to make him more favorable
terms than he makes to his tenant.</p>
<p>The more capable the tenant the more
favorable the terms he may exact. Certain
tenants are in demand and can have their
choice of farms. A prosperous-looking
man was pointed out recently as an example
of a tenant capable of buying a farm in one
of the most highly developed counties in the
United States. It was stated that as a renter
he could have his choice of any farm in
the county, but that he did not have a dollar
invested in farm land. Possibly he invests
his surplus earnings in stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>It is not the present purpose to determine
the relative merits of the different systems of
land tenure, but to try to be helpful to the
beginners by discussing the usual practices
in order that he may know whether the
arrangement he is considering is customary
and whether it is likely to prove satisfactory.</p>
<p>Every third farm in the United States is
rented under one of three methods:</p>
<p>1. A definite money rent may be paid,
ranging from $2 to $6 an acre for land on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
which the ordinary, staple crops are raised.
Perhaps $3 to $4 is more commonly paid
for such land.</p>
<p>2. In the South it is common for the landlord
to require a definite number of pounds
of cotton per acre or a certain number of
bales of cotton for a one or two-mule farm,
as the case may be. This is classified
by the census authorities as cash
rent, but will here be called crop
rent. Crop rent is less common than either
cash or share rent in the northern and western
states, although perhaps the most common
form in the South. Crop rent, however,
is met with in some sections, as in
western New York where certain large landowners
require a definite number of bushels
of wheat, oats or maize and make certain
stipulations as to hay and straw. They
charge a cash rent for pasture.</p>
<p>3. Much the most common form of tenancy,
however, is that where a certain percentage
or share of the product is given the
landlord for the use of the land.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>Before entering into a discussion of the
customary conditions under which land is
rented on shares it may be helpful to point
out the fundamental differences between
cash rent, crop rent and share rent. In case
of cash rent, the landlord takes no risk,
either as to the price or the amount of
product. In the case of crop rent, he shares
the risk as to the variation in price, but not
as to the amount of crop raised. The latter
may depend upon the clemency of the
weather or upon the industry and skill of
the tenant. In the case of share rent, both
landlord and tenant share equally as to
variation in the price and the amount of
product.</p>
<p>Three forms of share rent may be recognized:</p>
<p>(a) Where landlord furnishes only real
estate (land and buildings), the tenant supplying
everything else, including teams,
machinery, labor, seeds and fertilizers.
Under these conditions it is customary for
the landlord to receive one-third and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
tenant two-thirds of the crop raised or the
product produced.</p>
<p>(b) The second form of share rent is
where the landlord furnishes the real estate;
the tenant supplies teams, tools and labor,
while the landlord and tenant own equally
all live stock other than teams, and bear
equally all other expenses, as for seeds, fertilizers
and cost of threshing. Under this
system, it is customary for landlord and
tenant each to receive one-half of all sales.
As each owns one-half of all the live stock
(teams excepted), each shares equally in all
increase. The landlord pays for the cost
of permanent improvements such as new
buildings, fences, repairs and drainage.
The tenant, in making these improvements,
in some cases, agrees to furnish two days
labor for one days pay. The theory is that,
while the increased value of the real estate
is of advantage only to the landlord, the
improved facilities are of some benefit to
the tenant. Since he can do this work at odd
times when not otherwise employed, he can
afford to take a generous view of the matter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
It is obvious that if he remains on the
farm long enough the tenant will come into
his share of the benefit, while if he intends
to leave the farm soon he may not. There
is in the mind of the writer a prosperous
tenant who, after eighteen years
on a single farm, declared he had no desire
to make a change, and doubtless there are
thousands of similar instances.</p>
<p>Under the plan in which the tenant furnishes
everything except the real estate, the
tendency of the farm is apt to be downward
both as to the improvements and the crop-producing
power of the soil. The interests
of the landlord and tenant are not mutual.
This condition of tenancy leads to growing
only those crops which can be readily sold
from the farm and to frequent changes of
the tenant, with its accompanying auction
sales of property. In one region, where
this system prevails, it has been facetiously
remarked that each tenant has a sale every
year to determine how much he is worth.
It is less trouble than taking an inventory.</p>
<p>In the second form of share rent, the interests
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
of landlord and tenant are more
nearly mutual. Under this system, animal
husbandry is possible, which, generally,
involves pasturing and feeding a considerable
part of the crops upon the farm, and
even the purchase of nitrogenous by-products.
All this leads to permanency of
tenant, since the landlord and tenant are
both interested in the live stock and other
personal property, which cannot be divided,
with economy, each year. It is interesting
to note that the house is the least likely to be
kept in repair. The improvement of the
barns and fences or the laying of tile drains
increases the landlords income, but he has
no financial interest in the house, so long as
the tenant is willing to live in it.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many variations in
the arrangement of details between the landlord
and tenant. On many dairy farms in
the northeastern states it is customary for
the landlord to own the cows. While the
landlord and tenant share equally from the
sale of milk, butter or cheese, in such cases
the increase in the herd belongs to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
owner of the land. Hence, money from the
sale of any animal, old or young, goes to
him. This is because the landlord must
keep up the herd. If a cow is sold, he must
furnish another to take her place.</p>
<p>(c) The third type of tenant farming is
where the tenant furnishes nothing but his
labor and managerial ability, and receives
a share of the sales, which may be one-third.
This is rather an unusual type of tenancy,
since, where the landlord furnishes all the
capital, it is much more common to employ
a farm manager at a monthly wage. The
wage varies greatly, but is seldom below
forty dollars or above seventy-five dollars
per month without board, especially to
those who have not hitherto had much
managerial experience.</p>
<p>Various attempts at profit sharing have
been made. A recent instance is of a young
married man taking 160 acres of tillable
land where the landlord has a fairly well-stocked
farm. The young man is to have a
house and everything in the way of living
the farm can furnish. He is to receive $20
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
a month and one-half the net proceeds, or,
what is called in Chapter XI, the farm
income. In considering a contract of this
kind it is necessary to make a careful distinction
between: (1) Gross sales, (2) net
proceeds, viz.: the gross sales less the expenses
of running the farm, and (3) profits,
which may be defined for the purpose of
this discussion as the net proceeds less the
interest on the investment.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>
<p>Assuming 160 acres of land, all tillable,
devoted to dairy farming in eastern United
States, gross sales may be estimated at $20
an acre, or an annual gross income of $3,200,
and the net proceeds at $10 an acre, or
$1,600. Under these conditions the young
mans income would be $240, received as
wages, plus $800, as his share of the net
proceeds, or a total of $1,040 a year.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, probably a more
satisfactory method, both for landlord and
the farm manager, would be to pay the
latter as nearly as may be what his services
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
should be worth and give him in addition
one-half the profits; that is, one-half of that
which was left after deducting the expenses
of running the farm and interest on the capital
invested.</p>
<p>Merely for illustrating the method of
calculation, let us assume this farm with its
equipment to be worth $100 an acre, or
$16,000. Let the farm manager be paid
$840 a year. Assume the same gross income,
$3,200, and the same cost of operating,
$1,600, to which add $600, the additional
salary of the manager. The total
expense is then $2,200, and the net proceeds
$1,000. If 4%, or $640, was charged on the
investment, there would be $360 to be
divided between landlord and manager,
making the salary of manager $1,020. A
simple calculation will show that if 5%
were charged, the salary of the manager
would be $940 a year, and if 6%, $860 a
year. The advantage of the latter method
of employment is that the young man runs
less risk, while both receive equally any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
surplus beyond fair wages and fair interest
on the investment.</p>
<p>In this connection it is important to consider
how much may be reasonably paid for
managerial ability. A study of the figures
on page
<a href="#page_133">133</a>
will show that the labor income
from a considerable number of farms of the
better class was about 7% of the capital
invested in the farms. The inference is,
therefore, that if a man has $10,000 wisely
invested in a farm he may pay $700 for a
working manager; or, to put it in another
form, before the owner of a farm can afford
to pay $1,200 a year for a farm manager,
he should have about $17,000 invested.
Moreover, this investment must be in a form
calculated to return an income. If part of
it consists of investments for pleasure or
fancy, such investment will not only not add
to the income, but will detract from it by
increasing the cost of maintenance.</p>
<p>This is scarcely less important to the employee
than it is to the employer, since if
the owner pays a higher salary than the
manager can earn, he quite surely will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
sooner or later discharge his manager. This
may result disastrously for the discharged
young man, not merely on account of the
loss of employment, but because his failure
may militate against his securing satisfactory
employment elsewhere. When an employer
is seeking a man, he looks for one
who has succeeded. There is an old saying,
Nothing succeeds like success, and it is
only too true that nothing fails like failure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>FARM ORGANIZATION</h3>
</div>

<p>In the last chapter were discussed the
most common methods by which a young
man acquires an opportunity to engage in
farming. This chapter will discuss some
less common arrangements by which may be
bridged that period between the time the
son is ready to go into the business and the
time he may assume the complete control
of the ancestral or other farm. It will also
suggest a method for the continuous business
management of a farm enterprise.</p>
<p>As stated, the most common reason for a
farm changing from one family to another
is the fact that no heir is willing to assume
the obligation which is involved in paying
for the interest of the other heirs. Connected
with this problem is the further fact
that the father is not usually ready to give
up the management of the farm at the time
one of his sons reaches the age to go into
active business.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>The reason for this state of affairs is made
clear by the results of insurance statistics.
The period that a man may be expected to
live can be obtained by taking the difference
between his present age and 90 and dividing
the remainder by two. Thus, a young man
who is 20 may reasonably expect to live 35
years, or until he is 55 years old. A man at
50, however, still has an expectation of life
of 20 years, and the man of 70 of 10 years.</p>
<p>A farmer of 50 will usually have one or
more sons ready to go to farming if they
ever expect to engage in farming. But, as
has been shown, a man of 50 has a reasonable
expectation of 20 more years of life and
cannot turn over the farm to his son, completely,
without destroying his own opportunity
for earning a livelihood. As things
are usually arranged, therefore, there is no
place on the average farm for the son, except
as a hired hand, which is not desired permanently
by either father or son.</p>
<p>Frequently the father fails to appreciate
the earning power of his son, and, what is
more important, that the boy has grown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
into a man. One day a teacher called a
student of agriculture to his office, when
the following conversation occurred:</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g0002.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 500px; height: 297px;' /><br />
<p class='captionc' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 500px;'>
John Armstrong, Austinburg, Ashtabula county, Ohio, was a dairy tenant farmer for twenty years with nothing to show for his labor but a debt of $500. He then bought the farm of 144 acres on which he lives, without cash payment, assuming a debt of $7,000. At the end of ten years he owned his farm and equipment valued at $20,000. He has two sons who have been important factors in his success. A year ago one of them married and went to a farm of his own, the father paying him $3,000 for his former labor.<br />
</p>

<p class='captionc' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 500px;'>
John M. Hunt, Ackley, Iowa, two years a student at Iowa State College. He returned to the home farm of 120 acres, which, without any capital, he rented from his father. At the age of 25 his gross receipts from this farm were a little over $4,000. After paying rent, living, keeping a family of four, a few trips to fairs and corn shows, he had net $1,500 for his years work. Picture shows home with father, mother and sister in the foreground.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The Bureau of Soils at Washington,
said the teacher, has asked me to recommend
several of our students to them for
positions as field assistants. If you desire
to have me do so, I would be glad to
recommend you for one of these positions.
The compensation is $1,000 a year and field
expenses.</p>
<p>I do not believe that I can accept, said
Mr. Manning, my father is in poor health
and needs my help on the farm.</p>
<p>Does your father want you to take
charge of the farm and manage it so that
you can make your training count?</p>
<p>No; my father expects to continue to
manage the farm. He wishes me to work
for him.</p>
<p>How much does your father expect to
pay you?</p>
<p>Thirty dollars a month.</p>
<p>The teacher found it extremely difficult
not to interfere, but he merely said, This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
is a case of filial duty which you must settle
for yourself. I must have nothing further
to say.</p>
<p>The young man returned to the ancestral
home and is probably still there. It is, of
course, impossible to determine the merits
of an individual case, but this incident represents
a type of cases where the son makes
two important sacrifices from the sense of
duty.</p>
<p>First, he sacrifices present, and, perhaps,
future opportunity to earn the wages of
which he is capable and to which he is
justly entitled. And, second, and more important,
he sacrifices the opportunity to
develop his own powers and make concrete
his own abstract self.</p>
<p>There are two things that every young
man should do. One is to earn a living. A
man that cannot or does not earn a living is
of no value to himself or to anyone else.
The other is to develop within himself his
latent possibilities. He must apply himself
to some problem, or problems, and through
them develop his own personality. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
is no place where more intricate and satisfying
problems may be found than in the
development of a successful farming enterprise.
In the instance cited, the father may
have been unable to pay his son the wage he
might have obtained elsewhere, but he did
not need to dwarf his sons development by
treating him merely as a hired hand. His
willingness to do so was probably due to his
failure to appreciate that his son had become
a man.</p>
<p>Sometimes a father is astute enough to
reorganize his business so as to retain a
place for himself while giving to his sons
that opportunity which every man must
have who develops himself normally.</p>
<p>An Ohio farmer once came to the Deans
office. He had a son in college who was
just completing the first year of a two years
course in agriculture.</p>
<p>I should like to have you find a place
for my son in a cheese factory during the
coming summer, said Mr. McKinley.</p>
<p>I own a farm of 130 acres on which I
have a herd of Jersey cattle, continued the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
father. I have two sons and one daughter.
I would like to have my sons about me, but
there is no place for them on my farm because
I am there and cannot get away. In
fact, I do not desire to give up the management
of the farm and the development of
the herd of cattle.</p>
<p>Not every father sees the situation as
clearly as you do, interjected the Dean.</p>
<p>This is my plan. After my son has spent
a summer in a cheese factory, I want him
to come back to your school for another
year. I want him to learn, especially, all
you teach about dairying. I will then build a
cheese factory on my own farm and my son
will make into cheese the milk of my own
herd, and also from the herds of our neighbors.
By the time he has completed his
work with you, my younger son will have
finished the high school. He has some liking
for trading, and he will sell the cheese
at wholesale and deliver it to the surrounding
towns where markets are unexcelled.
As for the daughter, continued this practical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
man, she will get married and that
will take care of her.</p>
<p>What became of the daughter is not
known to the writer, but the rest of the program
was carried out successfully and continued
for many years.</p>
<p>A German came to this country and settled
in New Jersey, where he established a
large orchard. In course of time his two
sons grew into manhood. While, of course,
requiring plenty of laborers, the orchardist
did not need the sons in the management
of his farm. He, therefore, established one
of these sons in the commission business in
Philadelphia, thus, at least, keeping the
profits on the sale of the products of his
orchard in the family. He also needed cold
storage for his fruit. The other son started
a cold storage plant, which plays an important
part in the profitable management of
the orchard. Thus both sons have independent
employment requiring managerial
ability and the orchard is much more profitable
than it otherwise would be.</p>
<p>Our land laws, our traditions and our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
practices are based upon the idea that a farm
is to provide activity and support for but one
family. In order, therefore, that the son
may marry and begin to develop his life in
his own way, it is essential to reorganize in
some manner the method of managing the
farm or to enlarge or, perhaps, specialize
its activities. This may be accomplished on
a simple partnership basis, or it may be in
some such line as outlined in the illustrations
which have been given. In other occupations
such co-operative effort is the rule
rather than the exception. That it is more
difficult to effect satisfactory arrangements
in farming must be conceded, else they
would be more common. Doubtless it will
often tax the ingenuity of father and son to
devise the plans best suited to meet their
particular problem.</p>
<p>There still remains to consider another
form of business relation as applied to
farming which has become almost universal
in trade and transportation. The following
incident may illustrate and emphasize the
problem better than abstract discussion:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
One day a man walked into an office and
stated that a friend had a half million dollars
to invest in farming, provided that he
could be convinced that the money would
be invested profitably.</p>
<p>Does your friend desire to buy land in
any particular locality?</p>
<p>Yes, replied the promoter, he wishes
to buy land near &mdash;&mdash;. He has some
sentiment about it. He was born in that
neighborhood.</p>
<p>Well, that is a rather bad beginning.
Farming on sentiment is dangerous, especially
when the sentiment is in no way related
to the business.</p>
<p>The facts were that the region indicated
was recognized to be one of the most
unpromising sections of the state.</p>
<p>If you undertake to invest a half million
dollars in one neighborhood, continued the
adviser, you will pretty certainly fail to
earn interest on your investment.</p>
<p>Why? inquired the promoter.</p>
<p>Before you could possibly buy any considerable
part of the land the owners of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
farms you desire to buy would have
doubled or perhaps trebled the price asked
for their holdings. It is one thing to earn
interest on an investment of $30 an acre and
quite another to earn an equal per cent on
$60 or $90 an acre.</p>
<p>In the second place, farmers are content
to accept less per cent on their capital than
they would if it was loaned at interest,
because the farm furnishes a home as well
as a business. When you buy up all these
farms and convert them into a single enterprise
you will destroy their home value.
You cannot hope to compete with the man,
who, because his farm furnishes him a
home, is content with an otherwise small
return on his investment.</p>
<p>There were other reasons, of course, why
such an enterprise would fail, which the
speaker did not stop to explain.</p>
<p>You are mistaken, challenged the
promoter. I intend to meet both your
objections. My plan is to form a corporation
and issue both preferred and common
stock. The preferred stock shall bear 5%
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
and that will belong to my friend who furnishes
the money. I will retain the common
stock. Five per cent is all the owner of the
money is entitled to, while if the business
returns more than that amount, it will be
due to my management. I, and those associated
with me, are entitled to all that is
made above five per cent. By retaining the
common stock the surplus income will come
to us. Neither will I destroy the home
value, because I shall associate the former
owners with me in the conduct of the estate
and may give them some of the common
stock, so that they will be interested with me
in making a profitable return. If they wish
to keep their money invested in the farm,
they will be given preferred stock in place
of cash for their farms.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that the promoter
never convinced his friend that he could
successfully invest for him a half million
dollars along the lines indicated. Nevertheless
the corporate plan is not without
merit. For example, if a father should incorporate
his farm, he could provide for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
the inheritance of the preferred stock,
among the heirs, as he desires. He could
give to the son who operates the farm all
the common stock, together with what preferred
stock he is entitled or the father may
desire him to have. The common stock
would provide the means by which the
income from the farm, which was due to
the sons skill and management, might go
to him. As time went on the son could
acquire additional preferred stock from the
father or other heirs, or he could invest his
earnings elsewhere, as might seem most expedient.
On the death of the parents, the
preferred stock would be distributed as
inheritance or the will provided without in
any way interfering with the continuity of
the farm enterprise. If at any time the son
desired to discontinue the management of
the farm, all he would need to do would be
to dispose of his interest in the common
stock at whatever he might be able to secure
from the man who succeeded to its management.
He could sell or retain his preferred
stock.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>Farming is the one remaining great
industry that has not been organized so that
a single enterprise may have a continuous
existence. A corporation never dies, but at
least three generations of men occupy the
farms of the United States each century.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>OPPORTUNITIES IN AGRICULTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>Some years ago, a prominent magazine
contained an article entitled The
American Farmers Balance Sheet, in
which a descendant of the second and sixth
Presidents of the United States was shown
to have made in one year a profit of over
$19,000 from a 6,000-acre wheat farm in
North Dakota, and over $50,000 from a
6,000-acre corn farm in Iowa. A few
months later there appeared in the same
magazine another article, the purport of
which was that great wealth, whether it be
obtained from farming, the mining of coal,
the manufacture of steel or the selling of
merchandise, is the exception, while the
man, in whatever calling, who rears and
educates a family and at the same time lays
by a small competence is the normal American
product. The moral is that a $500-a-year-income
farm is a more important
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
factor to the national welfare than a
$50,000-a-year-income farm.</p>
<p>In the latter article the writer tells of two
brothers who had been reared on a Michigan
farm. Reuben was tired of the country.
He went to the city and apprenticed
himself to a harnessmaker. Against the
advice of young friends, Lucien bought
sixty acres of land and ran in debt for it.</p>
<p>In a year Reuben was earning a dollar a
day. He wore a white shirt and pointed
shoes, not because they were more comfortable,
but because other people did. He
had no debts. Lucien had fair crops, but
they yielded no more than enough to pay
interest on the mortgage. He wore a ragged
shirt, patched breeches and cowhide boots.
People said that Reuben was making a gentleman
of himself and learning a trade in
the bargain.</p>
<p>In two years, Reuben had completed his
apprenticeship. He was now earning $10
a week. He lived in a house that had a
fancy veranda and green blinds. His clothing
improved. Lucien was still ragged, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
he paid his interest and $300 each year upon
the principal. People said that Reuben,
the harnessmaker, was bound to come to the
front.</p>
<p>In ten years more, Reuben was still foreman
of the shop at $50 a month. He lived
in the same house, and smoked Havana
cigars. Lucien built a new house and a
barn. He smoked a pipe. The neighbors
saw that every year he made some improvement
on the farm. He wore a white shirt
when he went to town, and he had a pair
of button shoes. People said that Lucien
was becoming a prominent man. His word
was good at the bank.</p>
<p>Reuben began to complain that harnessmaking
was too confining. His health was
breaking down. The proprietor was selfish.
He would not die and leave the business to
him. Harnessmaking was not what it used
to be. Lucien bought more land. He went
fishing when he wanted to. Reuben came
out now and then to spend Sunday. The
birds seemed to sing more sweetly than ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
before and the grass was greener. Lucien
endorsed Reubens note.</p>
<p>Lucien has pigs, and cows, and sheep, and
chickens, and turkeys, and horses. He raises
potatoes and beans, and corn, and wheat,
and garden stuff, and fruit. He buys his
groceries and clothing and tobacco. Reuben
buys everything. At the close of the year
Lucien puts from $100 to $300 in the bank
or takes a trip to Washington. Reuben does
well if he come out even. Lucien does not
fret; Reuben grumbles.</p>
<p>The picture is true to life. It has been
enacted and re-enacted in every one of the
older communities of the United States.</p>
<p>It has always seemed to the writer, however,
that the author of this suggestive story
left out two important personages. They
were Sarah, the wife of Reuben, and Mary,
the wife of Lucien. Sarah liked to make
tatting and to go to pink teas. Mary preferred
to raise flowers and fluffy little
chickens. Nothing is to be said for or
against the taste of either. Each has a right
to her preference, but their point of view
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
cannot be left out of the problem when a
young man is considering his future occupation.</p>
<p>It has been said, and probably with considerable
truth, that most congressmen
would not hang around Washington if it
were not for their wives.</p>
<p>No one must mistake this story as an
attempt to compare harness making with
farming, much less to compare living in the
city with life in the open country.</p>
<p>What it does is to compare the struggle
and the development of the man who goes
into business for himself with the man who
accepts employment at wages.</p>
<p>Because of less responsibility and less
sacrifices at the beginning, the tendency is
for young men to work for wages rather
than to engage in business for themselves.
This is becoming more and more true as industrial
methods make it more and more
difficult for the young man to command the
requisite capital.</p>
<p>The man who works for wages usually
has the larger income and appears the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
prosperous during the earlier years as compared
with his brother who enters business.
The business man, however, who, while
young, economizes and invests his savings
in his business gradually outstrips his wage-earning
brother. During later life he is
able to enjoy the fruits of his earlier
economy and investments, while failing
powers and keen competition of younger
and better trained men restrict the opportunities
of the wage earner, who has generally
spent his wages in better living, or at
least in more outward show.</p>
<p>This is well shown by the fact that it is
customary to make provision by means of
pensions for wage earners of all sorts, while
no such arrangement is made for men who
engage in business, be that farming, trade or
transportation.</p>
<p>For many reasons, however, young men
will continue to seek employment at wages,
even if only for a few years, or until some
capital has been acquired which may be
invested in business.</p>
<p>The question arises, therefore, what opportunities
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
there may be for the young man
who desires to engage, eventually, in the
business of farming to work for wages along
lines that will not be too far removed from
the business in which he is subsequently to
engage. It will be assumed that the young
man has prepared himself in that same
painstaking way that he would if he were
preparing to become an engineer, a lawyer
or a physician.</p>
<p>There is a constant demand for men with
proper training as managers of farms. As
stated elsewhere, the wages are seldom less
than $40 nor more than $75 a month to beginners,
although for men of experience
$5,000 a year has been paid in exceptional
cases for the management of large enterprises.
These positions often constitute ideal
opportunities for capable young men. They
require, however, not only an intimate
knowledge of farming, but the ability, also,
to manage men.</p>
<p>The ability to manage men requires the
combination of decision and tact, not possessed
by all, and not easily acquired by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
education or practice. Not only must the
farm manager be able to manage workmen,
but oftentimes he must manage his employer,
who may have little knowledge of
farming but still insists upon having his
own ideas executed, as he, of course, has a
perfect right to do.</p>
<p>Another danger is the fact that where the
farm is owned by a man engaged in other
business, many circumstances may arise to
cause the owner to change his plans or sell
his property. There is often, therefore, a
lack of permanency in these positions.</p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture
employs upward of 5,000 people.
There is a constant demand for young men
to recruit this service, including experts in
soils, plant production, animal husbandry,
dairying, chemistry and forestry. Beginners
receive from $800 to $1,000 a year. When
they are sent out of Washington into field
service, as many of them are, they receive
their expenses, including subsistence in
addition. Young men may rise rather
rapidly by promotion to $1,600 a year, then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
more slowly to $2,000, while an occasional
man is promoted to the more responsible
position paying $3,000 to $4,000 a year.</p>
<p>The positions are all filled through the
competitive civil service examinations. Examinations
are held at more or less irregular
intervals, usually several times a year, in
various sections of the country. A letter
addressed to the United States Civil Service
Commission will secure the necessary information
concerning openings and the
general requirements for the examinations.</p>
<p>Employment in the United States Department
of Agriculture often affords opportunity
for varied experience and wide
observation of farming methods throughout
the country. Such employment is generally
to be considered desirable if not continued
for too long a period. As a matter of fact,
men are constantly leaving the service to
engage in practical or other work, a fact
which makes the demand for young men
greater than would otherwise be the case.</p>
<p>The various agricultural colleges and
experiment stations are constantly seeking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
men. It would seem that the demand would
eventually be satisfied. As a matter of fact,
however, it grows greater year by year,
both because these institutions continue to
grow and because young men are attracted
more and more to practical work. It is
stated that in one institution there were 46
graduates in the course in animal husbandry
and that 44 went into practical work and
only two sought employment in college or
station. The salaries are about the same as
in government positions.</p>
<p>Agricultural newspaper work offers an
attractive field for young men who are
properly trained and have a taste for this
kind of work.</p>
<p>There is also beginning to be quite a demand
for teachers of agriculture in the high
schools. As a rule a man is wanted who
can teach, in addition, the sciences usually
taught in secondary school. The customary
salary is from $70 to $100 a month on an
eight to ten months basis. An experience
of one or two years as a teacher in a high
school, or even the lower grades of the public
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
school, should be invaluable to the young
man who expects subsequently to engage in
farming. This is particularly true if he has
not had the opportunity of a college
training.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, unnecessary to state that
the salaries mentioned in this chapter are
obtained only by young men who possess
certain qualifications. To secure them, they
must be men of ability, integrity, virtue and
industry. No man who is not willing to
make the preparation necessary to master
his subject can expect to succeed. He must,
also, be a man of absolute honesty, and he
must lead a clean life. It was Bismarck who
said, of German university students, One-third
die out; one-third rot out; the other
third rule Germany. Every man who will
may choose whether he will belong to
Bismarcks second or third class.</p>
<p>The question for the young man of 20 is
not merely as to the morrow, but what is
likely to be the trend of events during the
next 35 to 50 years.</p>
<p>In 1800 the United States nowhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
crossed the Mississippi and nowhere
touched the Gulf of Mexico. In 1850 the
country west of the Mississippi River was
agriculturally largely an undiscovered
region. Since 1870 we have much more
than doubled our population and our agriculture.
Since that time we have subdued
more of the open country to the uses of man
than we had been able to do in 250 years of
our previous history.</p>
<p>During the past 300 years we have prided
ourselves upon being an agricultural people.
We have been an agricultural people,
but our problems have not been chiefly
those of the agriculturist, but those of the
engineer.</p>
<p>Our problem, in the past, has not been to
make two blades of grass to grow where but
one grew before. Our problem has been to
harvest and transport two bushels of wheat
or two bales of cotton with the labor previously
required to harvest one. Our crops
have been so abundant that the agricultural
problems connected with the growing of
them has been secondary to the engineering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
problems of their harvesting and transportation.
The self-binder and the steam locomotive
have been our achievements.</p>
<p>If the writer mistakes not, the future
problem will not be so much the harvesting
and transporting, as the growth of the crops.
In the future, young men will be needed
who have studied the science of living things
in order that they may make, literally, two
blades of grass to grow where but one grew.
To men who will be able to do so, will come
success and honor.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>WHERE TO LOCATE</h3>
</div>

<p>Unless the young farmer expects to
return to the ancestral home, the first
question he must settle is where he is going
to locate. Indeed, one of the most common
questions asked is, What do you think of
this state or that state or this region or that
as a place to farm? There are few
questions harder to answer. This is due,
among other reasons, to the fact that every
place has its advantages and disadvantages.
The sum of the advantages may be greater
in one place than in another, but if these
advantages are known they must generally
be paid for.</p>
<p>New adaptations, however, may change
materially the value of the land in a given
locality as, for example, the discovery that
a region is especially adapted to raising
alfalfa, onions, cabbages, apples or peaches.
Changing conditions, as the growth of population
or better transportation facilities, may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
materially affect the attractiveness of a region
from the standpoint of the farmer.</p>
<p>The competition of other regions which
grow similar crops is a potent factor in
determining the desirability of a region.
For example, the farmers east of the Allegheny
mountains during the nineteenth
century competed with the farmers of the
central West who had free, fertile, easily
tilled land on which to grow maize, wheat
and oats. Cattle and sheep were pastured
on the open range. The twentieth century
has found the land of this region settled and
capitalized in some instances beyond that
of the eastern states; thus one factor at least
of competition has been eliminated.</p>
<p>While farm values readjust themselves in
time, it often happens, especially in the
older settled regions, that farm values are
slow in reflecting these changes in economic
conditions. Changed conditions often call
for a change in farm methods which the
habits and traditions of even one generation
prevent. To the man who is able to apply
the proper methods the region may be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
desirable one, although under existing conditions
the results may be unsatisfactory.
The young man, however, is cautioned at
this point not to be overconfident of his own
ability. Under such circumstances it is well
to study the problem with great care, because
the methods which seem unwise to the
casual observer may, after all, be found to
be based upon sound economic principles.</p>
<p>A man of 25 who is looking for a location
should not only study the present conditions
of the locality, but try to predict what is
likely to be the future of the region during
the next third of a century, since this is the
period in which he may reasonably expect
to be personally interested, although later in
life he will find himself quite as much interested
in the more distant future on
account of his children.</p>
<p>Nothing is more self-evident than that
one should choose a region, especially as
regards soil and climate, which is adapted
to the crop or crops to be raised, yet there are
probably more failures due to a lack of crop
adaptation than to any other cause that is not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
personal to the man himself. Not only do
apples, for their best success, require certain
soil types, but different varieties of
apples require for their best development,
distinctly different types of soil as, for example,
Rhode Island Greening, Baldwin,
York Imperial and Grimes Golden. Each
reaches its best development on different
types of soil and some require different
climatic conditions. In like manner apples
and peaches require distinctly different
types of soil for the best success of each and
for this reason peaches are not desirable as
fillers in apple orchards.</p>
<p>If at the proper season of the year one
goes from Pittsburg to Chicago via Columbus
and Indianapolis, he will see great fields
of winter wheat and a considerable number
of permanent pastures. From Chicago to
Omaha he will see only occasionally a field
of wheat and scarcely any permanent pasture.
Oats have taken the place of wheat.
In parts of Eastern Kansas and Oklahoma
the predominant crop is winter wheat.
Throughout the whole region from Pittsburg
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
to Topeka, Kansas, the characteristic
crop is maize or Indian corn. Between St.
Paul and Fargo, the main crops are spring
wheat and oats. One may travel from Winnipeg,
Manitoba, to Calgary, Alberta, a
distance of over one thousand miles without
seeing a field of maize. In some portions
the main crop is wheat, in others it is oats.</p>
<p>These are illustrations of the crop adaptation
over large areas, which has come about
unconsciously, as has most crop adaptation.
In other parts of the United States are to be
found even more striking examples of crop
adaptation, although the areas are much
smaller, as in the case of tobacco, potatoes,
celery, onions, apples, peaches and other
fruits. Regions containing residual soils
are more variable in crop adaptation than
drift soils and require more careful watchfulness
on the part of those who may wish
to buy land.</p>
<p>As previously stated, advantages, if
known, must usually be paid for. It comes
about, therefore, that if a region or a farm
is adapted to the raising of a certain crop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
which is more profitable than the average,
such as maize, tobacco, alfalfa, celery, apples
or peaches, this land will, other things
being equal, command a higher price than
land which does not possess this characteristic.</p>
<p>There is an underlying economic principle
which the man who goes out to choose
a farm should clearly understand. The
principle has been stated by Fairchild as
follows: The normal value of products
capable of indefinite multiplication tends
always toward the value of least costly. On
the other hand, if any production cannot be
largely extended, so that the supply barely
meets the requirements of the purchasers,
the tendency of normal values is toward the
cost of the most costly part of the product
required to meet wants.</p>
<p>This principle explains why land especially
adapted to raising maize is higher
priced than land primarily adapted to raising
wheat. Maize which enters into commerce
is raised almost exclusively in ten
states of the United States. Wheat is harvested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
practically every month of every year
in different parts of the world. The young
farmer should consider, therefore, whether
he is undertaking to raise crops in which
there is unlimited competition, or whether
soil or other conditions cause the output to
be relatively limited.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>SIZE OF FARM</h3>
</div>

<p>The size of the farm is another of those
questions on which there is endless debate
and to which no general answer can be
given. There are, however, certain rather
definite principles which may help in
settling an individual problem.</p>
<p>The size of the farm is related to the income
per acre. If ones ideal or purpose is
a gross income of $1,000 or $3,000 or $5,000
a year, he must consider how large a farm
will be necessary to bring this return.</p>
<p>Assume, for the sake of discussion, it is
desired to obtain a gross income of $4,000.
In the eastern United States 200 acres of
tillable land devoted to general farming may
bring this amount. If the land is especially
adapted to potatoes, and this crop takes a
prominent place in the rotation, 100 acres
might be sufficient to return the income
named. Likewise a 100-acre retail milk
dairy farm may produce a similar result.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Forty acres devoted to truck farming or
market gardening may be sufficient.</p>
<p>There is another way that the size of the
farm needed may be estimated. There is a
general relation between the gross income
and the amount invested. In 1900 the gross
income of the farms of the United States
was 18 per cent of the total investment,
which includes land, buildings, tools, and
live stock. The average gross income varied
for the different types of farming common
to the northern United States from 16 to 19
per cent. This represents, of course, a great
deal of very poor farming. The income of
prosperous farmers must be somewhat better
than this. If we assume that by careful
methods the gross income is 25% of the total
investment, then an investment of $16,000
will be required to bring a gross income of
$4,000. While it is true that the gross income
has no necessary relation to net income
or profit, yet it is well to remember
that a gross income is a necessary antecedent
of a net income. The net profit from the
production of a bushel of wheat, a dozen of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
eggs, or a pound of butter is of comparatively
small consequence unless a sufficient
quantity is produced.</p>
<p>A recent investigation by the Cornell
station appears to show that with the type
of farming now existing in Tompkins and
Livingston counties, New York, where the
investigation chanced to be made, the larger
farms yielded the most profitable returns
and that while present conditions exist, the
size of farms is likely to increase rather than
decrease. The fundamental reason seems to
be the substitution of horse-drawn machinery
for hand labor.</p>
<p>The following table shows the labor income
on 586 farms operated by the owners,
classified according to size:</p>

<p>While the larger the farm, the more prosperous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
was the operating owner or tenant,
the size of the farm did not seem to affect
the profit of the landlord.</p>
<p>The amount of land one individual may
own is unlimited; the size of the farm unit
is limited. After a farm unit has reached
a certain size, depending upon the type of
farming, the general arrangement of the
farm and the skill in management, any further
increase will increase the cost of operation,
and as the increase continues eventually
cause a decrease in profits. Assuming this
to be true, it follows as a mathematical necessity
that as the farm increases in size the
total profits will increase as the farm increases
up to a given point and then the
profits will decrease. The following table
illustrates this law:</p>

<p>In both case A and case B it is assumed
that the greatest net profit per acre is to be
obtained with 160 acres, and that the net
profit per acre when the farm is of that size
is $5. In case A it is assumed that the net
profit would decrease $1 for each 80 acres
added, while in case B the decrease is
assumed to be only one-half as rapid. In
the first instance the net profit per farm increases
until 280 acres are reached, when
the net profit per farm decreases, until at 560
acres no profit would be obtained. In case
B the net profit per farm increases until 480
acres are reached. Everyone is cautioned
not to accept these figures as representing
what would actually happen. All that can
be said is that as the farm unit increases in
size there will come a point at which the net
profit per acre will decrease because of the
physical difficulty of managing a large area,
and, therefore, there is a limit to the size of
a single farm. Fifteen thousand acres may
lay in one tract and be owned by one individual,
firm or corporation, but its economic
management requires for purely physical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
reasons, not to mention others, that it be
managed in several units more or less distinct
from one another. Just what the size
of this unit will be no one knows and it will
vary with the type of farming, the type of
farmer and many other circumstances. For
example, a very common unit for a tenant
cotton farm is between 20 and 50 acres, both
the product and the farmer being a limiting
factor.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important lesson to be
learned from a study of this table is that it
is wise for some men to operate a farm of
320 acres, others of 160 acres and still others
of 80 acres, because each size of farm presents
a task suited to different abilities. It
would be as futile for one fitted to operate
only an 80-acre farm to attempt to manage
320 acres as it would be unwise for the man
capable of conducting 320 acres to confine
his attention to 80 acres. Unfortunately
while this principle is not difficult to perceive
and is easily stated, it is practically
impossible to make any application of it to
an individual case. Only time and the inexorable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
laws of competition will adjust
men to their several tasks.</p>
<p>It will be of interest to note what influence
in actual practice the type of farming
has upon the size of the farm. The census
reports the average size of all farms in the
United States as 147 acres, with the different
types as follows: Vegetables, 65 acres;
fruits, 75 acres; dairy products, 120 acres;
hay and grain, 159 acres; and live stock,
227 acres. Speaking in a very general way,
only about one-half the land on these farms
is in cultivated crops, while only 40% of the
income may be from the products which
cause the farm to be thus classified. The
young farmer will do well to have these
figures in mind when he starts out in life,
for while they are not to be followed literally,
they give him a measuring stick with
which to compare his operations.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>SELECTION OF FARM</h3>
</div>

<p>Having some of these preliminary
questions settled, or at least well in
mind, the young farmer is ready to inspect
individual farms with a view to purchasing
or renting. He should examine each farm
from four general aspects, namely: (1) The
character and topography of the soil, (2)
the climatic conditions, including healthfulness
and water supply, (3) the location, and
(4) the improvements.</p>
<p>It may be well at the outset to emphasize
the advantage which even a small difference
in fertility may bring. Suppose one farm
is capable of raising fifteen bushels of wheat
per acre and another twenty bushels. If
wheat is 80 cents a bushel, then the gross income
is $12 and $16 respectively. If it is
assumed that it costs in either case for seed,
labor and interest on investment $8 an acre
to raise and harvest the crop, then it will be
seen that an increase of five bushels an acre
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
doubles the profit. The comparison is perhaps
not quite fair, since it costs slightly
more to harvest the larger crop, but it serves
to illustrate the point.</p>
<p>Neither the crop adaptation nor the crop-producing
power of the soil can be determined
by taking a sample and submitting it
to a chemist for analysis. These factors can
best be determined by the character of the
vegetation, both domestic and wild, and by
a knowledge obtained through observation
or reading as to what this particular soil
type usually does. Every type of soil has
certain characteristics which under like conditions
it may be expected to reproduce,
much in the same manner as each species of
animal reproduces its characteristics.</p>
<p>The first essential is to be able to recognize
the different soil types. This can only
be done by close observation and study. The
second essential is to determine what the
crop-producing characteristics of these
types of soil are. This knowledge may be
obtained by personal observation; but as
most persons opportunities are limited in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
this direction, it should be supplemented
wherever possible by a study of the soil surveys
of the United States Department of
Agriculture wherever these are available.
When this is not possible samples of soil
may be submitted to the Bureau of Soils of
the United States Department of Agriculture
or to the soil division of the state experiment
station, together with a suitable
description and such knowledge of the history
of the land as is obtainable. In this
way you may obtain information as to the
natural adaptation of the particular type
of soil.</p>

Walter S. Tomlinson, Bryan, Ohio, began thirteen years ago with 225 acres, partly rented, to determine whether a farm could be made a satisfying enterprise. As tenant he has paid to himself as landlord $1,000 each year for rental and $500 each year as salary. The rest of the profits have been invested in 240 acres of additional land and in improvements. Mr. Tomlinsons specialty has been hogs, but he says it does not matter so much about the lines one adopts as the attention that is given them.<br />
</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='captionc' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 500px;'>
Dr. W. I. Chamberlain, Hudson, Ohio, graduate of Western Reserve University, former state secretary of agriculture, later college president. Farmer and institute lecturer and widely known for his editorial work on farm journals; has been able, amid his other activities, to manage his farm of 116 acres. The net cash income above all expenses from the farm for 1890 to 1907 was $113,966 or $1,370 per year. Of this income $8,877 were obtained from a ten-acre apple orchard.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>There will still remain the question of
the present condition of the land. For example,
the Pennsylvania station obtained in
a certain season 42 loads of hay from nine
acres of land. The same season, from exactly
the same soil type, the station obtained eight
loads of hay from 20 acres. The condition
of the soil was different, which the previous
history of the two tracts of land fully
explains.</p>
<p>It is of the utmost importance, therefore,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
to distinguish between the natural fertility
of the soil and the condition of the soil. A
further example will help to illustrate this
point. At the Rothamsted Station a certain
type of soil has for over 60 years produced
annually about 12 bushels of wheat
an acre without fertilizer, while with a
complete fertilizer the same type has produced
30 or more bushels. The 12 bushels
may be said to represent the natural fertility
of the soil, while the additional 18
bushels may be said to represent the condition
of the soil due to fertilizers or to other
conditions. On the other hand, the natural
condition of some other soil type might be
only eight bushels, or still another type
might be 16 bushels.</p>
<p>This principle is of considerable practical
importance, especially in the eastern
third of the United States. Generally speaking,
clay and silt soils have a greater natural
fertility than sandy soils; limestone soils
than those that are deficient in lime. Thus
soils that naturally grow chestnut trees, indicating
a low lime content, have a tendency
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
to deteriorate under exhaustive cropping
much more rapidly than limestone soils.
More fertilizers and other methods of soil
improvement are necessary in the case of
chestnut soils than in the case of limestone
valley soils. One of the first
questions to ask, therefore, concerning an
unknown farm in Pennsylvania is whether
or not chestnut trees grow naturally. It
does not follow, however, that chestnut soils
are undesirable. Much will depend upon
the crop or crops it is desired to raise. For
example, in some regions they are well
adapted to potatoes and peaches. In these
cases the cost of the fertilizers necessary to
keep the soil in proper condition is small
compared with the total return from the
crop.</p>
<p>The pioneers best guide as to the value of
new land was and is the vegetation growing
upon it, and, especially in a wooded country,
the native trees. Basswood, crab apple, wild
plum, black walnut, ash, hickory and hard
maple generally indicate a fertile soil.
White oak indicates only a moderate soil;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
bur oak, a somewhat warmer and better
drained soil. Beech indicates a rather poor
soil; a heavy clay, lacking in organic matter.
Certain species of elms, maples and oaks, as
red maple and the Spanish swamp oak, indicate
wet soils.</p>
<p>The occurrence and vigor of certain herbaceous
plants are especially indicative of
fertility of the soil, as, for example, ragweed,
bindweed, certain plants of the sunflower
family, such as goldenrod, asters and
wild sunflowers. Soils adapted to red
clover and alfalfa are usually well drained
and contain plenty of lime. Alsike clover
will grow on a soil too wet or containing too
little lime for either of the former. Soils
that produce sorrel and redtop when red
clover and timothy are sown need drainage
or liming or both. Sedges usually indicate
a wet soil, although certain species grow on
dry, sandy soils. The point of this paragraph,
however, is not to give comprehensive
advice but to cause the young farmer to
observe the conditions and make his own
applications, which will vary in different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
regions and under different circumstances.</p>
<p>Perhaps the one feature that the young
farmer is most likely to overlook in the
selection of a farm is the relative proportion
of tillable land. One farm of 200 acres,
may, on account of stony land, wet land,
comparatively unproductive woodland, or
because of the arrangement of fences and
roadways, contain only eighty acres of tillable
land, while another may contain 160
acres. This is one reason why a 160-acre
farm in the central West may be more valuable
than a farm of the same size in the
northeastern United States.</p>
<p>Columella says with regard to the selection
of land that there are two things chiefly
to be considered, the wholesomeness of the
air and the fruitfulness of the place, of
which if either the one or the other should
be wanting, and notwithstanding anyone
should have a mind to dwell there, he must
have lost his senses and ought to be conveyed
to his kinfolk to take care of him.</p>
<p>In selecting a farm do not fail to inquire
whether there has been any recent illness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
and if so the nature of it, either among the
persons living there or the domestic animals
kept.</p>
<p>Aside from healthfulness, climate is a
fundamental and controlling factor, both in
productiveness and economic farm management.
Temperature and rainfall affect the
number of days that work can be performed
upon the land and hence affect materially
the economy of labor. It is this fact that
prevents the systematic organization of
labor so common in manufacturing and
transportation. The climate also affects the
cost of producing live stock by modifying
the food and shelter required.</p>
<p>The climate of a region is best studied
from the reports of the United States
Weather Bureau rather than from the statements
published by interested parties. So
far as the production of crops is concerned
the distribution of rainfall is more important
than the annual amount, as may be
shown by comparing the rainfall in such
places as Columbus, Ohio, and Lincoln,
Nebraska.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>The average temperature during the
growing season is, of course, of more importance
from the standpoint of crop production
than the average annual temperature.
Maximum and minimum temperatures or
the range of temperature must be considered
as well as the average temperature.</p>
<p>One of the most practical questions to
determine is the average date of the last
killing frost in the spring and the date of the
first killing frost in the autumn; in other
words, the length of the growing season.
Both altitude and topography enter into this
problem. In a given locality killing frosts
will occur on a still night in the valley before
they do on the elevations, because the
air as it cools becomes heavier and flows
down into the lowest places just as water
would do. On the other hand, as the altitude
increases the growing season shortens.</p>
<p>Whenever I am asked a question involving
the production of farm crops by a
Pennsylvania farmer before answering, I
ask three questions: (1) Where are you
located? (2) Do chestnut trees grow naturally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
upon your land? (3) What is your
altitude?</p>
<p>One factor that is often overlooked by the
young farmer needs only to be mentioned
to be thoroughly appreciated. It is the
amount and character of the water supply.
Not only is this of the utmost importance
from the standpoint of the household, but it
is fundamental to the best farm management.
Thus, if the water supply is limited
the amount of live stock kept will be curtailed,
and thus the proper utilization of
farm products prevented and maintenance
of the fertility of the soil made more difficult.</p>
<p>The young farmer should recognize that
some kinds of farming are more dependent
upon the climatic conditions than others and
should, therefore, select the location best
suited to the type of farming desired or else
modify his type of farming to suit the
climatic conditions. If one studies critically
the types of farming in various parts
of the United States, it will be seen that they
have already been adjusted in large degree,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
either consciously or unconsciously, to the
climatic conditions. The young farmer
should be careful that he does not undertake
to butt his head against a stone wall.</p>
<p>Having found a farm that suits our ideal
as to the natural conditions, such as the crop
adaptation, fertility, topography and
climate, what may be called the artificial
conditions must be studied.</p>
<p>The location may be studied, both as to
local and distant markets and the means of
reaching each, which includes roadways
and shipping facilities. Here again much
will depend upon the products which are to
be sold. The man who raises tobacco, hogs
or beef cattle does not suffer any great
economic disadvantage by living ten miles
from a shipping station, but a man does who
produces milk, peaches, potatoes or hay.</p>
<p>In these days there is not much danger
that the character of the roadway will be
overlooked by the intending purchaser of
the farm, although sufficient importance
may not be given to the advantage of really
good roads, both as to grade and surface.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
Perhaps the one most important question to
consider in connection with the transportation
facilities is whether products may be
shipped without change from the shipping
station to the market it is desired to reach.</p>
<p>Although at first glance we may not like
the thought, it must be conceded that neighbors
are not only important morally and
socially, but they also may have economic
advantages and disadvantages. While it
may sometimes happen that it will be wise
to raise in a given neighborhood some
product that no one else has undertaken to
supply, yet as a rule, if a given neighborhood
is raising Jersey, or Guernsey or Holstein
cattle or Chester White, Berkshire or
Poland China hogs, or Southdown or
Shropshire or Cotswold sheep, it will be
wise to raise the breed commonly raised instead
of the least commonly raised breed, as
it is sometimes supposed. The more potato
growers or cabbage growers or celery raisers
or orchardists in a locality the better for
all concerned, for a number of reasons,
among which may be mentioned (1) the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
more and the better the products raised the
more buyers will seek the region and hence
the higher will be the price obtained for the
product; (2) the more of a given product
there is to ship the better the shipping facilities
for that product are likely to be; (3)
all the necessary supplies for the type of
farming can be more readily and cheaply
obtained; (4) there will be a better knowledge
of the business when more men have
had experience in raising the particular
crop.</p>
<p>These principles apply in all classes of
business; thus we find woolen factories in
Philadelphia, silk factories at Paterson,
N. J., cotton factories at Lowell, Mass., plow
factories at Moline, Ill., and steel mills at
Pittsburg. Many of these centers possessed
originally some natural advantages which
caused the location of the first factory, but
others have been drawn there on account of
the principles enunciated. The farmers of
a given region have a community of interest
as well as railroads. The young farmer
should recognize this fact and if necessary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
should exert himself to develop such interest
in his community, both for his own benefit
and that of his neighbors.</p>
<p>There are two classes of farms for which
the purchaser is in danger of paying too
much, one on which there are extensive improvements
and one on which there are
none at all. A farm with just barely enough
improvements for the conduct of the type
of farming it is proposed to develop can
usually be purchased most advantageously.
The purchaser should understand clearly
that the previous cost of the improvements
has no necessary relation to their present
value, any more than the value of a second-hand
suit of clothes is dependent upon its
original cost. All depends on how badly
they are worn and how well they are
adapted to present conditions. The value
of farm improvements is not unlike those in
other business enterprises in this respect.
Their value depends upon present and prospective
earning capacity and not on former
cost.</p>
<p>No rule can be laid down as to the relation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
which should exist between the value
of land itself and the value of the improvements.
In practice it varies greatly. In the
United States the farm improvements constitute
on an average 21% of the total value
of land, being as high as 45% in Massachusetts
and as low as 15% in Texas. The
young farmer may well consider, therefore,
whether he can earn interest on his investment
when the improvements cost more than
25% of the total value of the real estate. Certainly
when it becomes one-half it is excessive.
The man who runs a farm as an avocation
usually errs in putting too much money
into permanent improvements for the farm
to be a paying investment.</p>
<p>If it is admitted that the farm unit is limited
because of the physical difficulties of
managing large areas, then it must at once
be seen how important the arrangement of
the farmsteading must be to the successful
conduct of the farm. In the older farming
communities where the present farm holdings
are the result of several purchases or
sales the shape of the farm, the arrangement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
of the fields and the place of the farm buildings
become an extremely important matter.
Sometimes satisfactory rearrangements
are easily made, at other times they are quite
impossible. No attempt will be made to
discuss this subject in detail here, but the
young farmer should bring to this question
all the experience and study possible.</p>
<p>When the young farmer goes to inspect
a farm it is to be assumed that he will be
conducted over the farm by the owner or his
authorized agent. It is proper to give
respectful attention to everything that is
told him, provided he follows carefully the
California adage to believe nothing you
hear and only one-half what you see.</p>
<p>If a farm consists of 200 or 300 acres of
land, it is possible for the agent to convey
the purchaser over the farm in such a way
as to prevent the least desirable portions being
seen. If the farm has attracted the
seeker of land, he should not purchase until
he has made another visit, preferably some
days or weeks after the first one. He may
then very properly visit the farm alone, passing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
over quite a different course from that
pursued hitherto. Sketches and notes will
be found very helpful, and if the use of the
soil auger is understood it may be well employed
to study the character of both soil
and subsoil. During the interval between
visits some casual inquiries may be made
among those who know the history of the
farm in question, because the past history
of the farm obtained from unprejudiced
witnesses is of prime importance in arriving
at a conclusion concerning its value.</p>
<p>A farm is much more attractive when a
crop is growing upon it than when it is
without active vegetation. Poor land looks
relatively better than good land during or
just after a rain. Many matters concerning
the selection of a farm can only be learned
by some years of practical experience. The
young farmer will do well, therefore, to
secure the help of some more experienced
person. If he has among his acquaintances
a successful farmer of mature years he will
be fortunate if he can secure his advice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE FARM SCHEME</h3>
</div>

<p>Farming is no pink tea. It is a serious
business. After the young farmer has
selected the farm he must develop his farm
scheme. He must contemplate well and
seriously the philosophy which underlies
his plans. Unless he sees clearly what he is
striving to attain and unless he understands
the effect of his methods, he must fail in
great measure to obtain his goal.</p>
<p>Satisfactory results in farming cannot be
obtained as a general practice if the man is
only interested in the results of a single year.
For this reason the itinerant tenant system
will not be satisfactory unless the landlord
has worked out a satisfactory scheme which
he requires his tenant to follow.</p>
<p>It is not enough that a man shall grow a
single large crop, but it is necessary that he
should continue to grow a satisfactory crop
at least at regular intervals. For example,
a piece of land may be adapted to cabbage,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
celery, potatoes or hay. Assume for the
moment it is adapted to cabbage and that
by one or more seasons of preparation an
enormous crop of cabbages may be secured.
This fact is of little value unless sufficient
quantity is raised and the process
can be repeated annually. Cabbages cannot
be grown again on this particular piece of
land for from four to six years on account of
club root. If the farmer does not have other
areas which he can bring into cabbages
year after year, for from three to five
years, then he becomes a failure as a cabbage
raiser. Even a perennial, like alfalfa
or asparagus, should form a part of the general
scheme of crop production if the most
satisfactory results are to be obtained.</p>
<p>There are two general questions at the
basis of all farm schemes: (1) How to obtain
a fairly uniform succession of cash
products year after year, and (2) how to
keep up or improve the fertility of the soil
economically while doing so. In other
words, how to keep the investment from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
decreasing while it is earning a satisfactory
and fairly uniform income.</p>
<p>It is necessary, therefore, to consider what
products are to be sold and what are simply
subsidiary to the cash products. The cash
products may, of course, be soil products or
animal products, but more likely they will
be both. When animals form a large part
of the enterprise the cropping system must
be carefully adjusted to meet the needs of
these animals. Many apparently trivial details
must be considered, as for example,
whether the cropping system furnishes too
little or too much bedding for the live stock.</p>
<p>In considering profits the enterprise as a
whole must be kept in view. For example,
if a man is producing milk, it may be
cheaper, so far as the production of milk is
concerned, to allow the liquid excrement to
run to waste rather than to arrange for sufficient
bedding. If, however, by using an
abundance of bedding and saving all the
high-priced nitrogen and the larger part of
the potash in the manure, he is able to raise
twelve tons of silage in place of eight tons,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
or three tons of hay in place of two tons, his
enterprise as a whole will be more profitable
when he uses the extra amount of bedding,
although so far as the production of a quart
of milk is concerned the cost is increased.
It may be that by feeding corn to cattle or
sheep one will obtain only 50 cents a bushel
for his maize, while his neighbor is selling
it to the elevator at 60 cents. If, however,
the man who feeds his maize year after year
thereby raises 60 bushels instead of 40
bushels, his enterprise, as a whole, may be
more profitable than that of his neighbor.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the Pennsylvania experiment
station has substantially these two
conditions in certain of its fertilizer plats.
When for 25 years the conditions have been
similar to those where crops are sold from
the farm, the yields have been: Maize, 42
bushels; oats, 32 bushels; wheat, 14 bushels;
and hay, 2,783 pounds per acre. But when
conditions exist which represent the feeding
of corn, oats and hay and the return of
manure to the soil, the yields have been:
Maize, 58 bushels; oats, 41 bushels; wheat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
23 bushels; and hay 4,190 pounds per acre.
In the first instance the value of the products
has been $15.75 an acre, while in the
other case it has been $22.90 an acre.</p>
<p>Having worked out a cropping system
that gives the proper yearly production of
several crops desired, the next question to
decide is how this cropping system and the
disposition of the crops is going to affect
the fertility of the soil. From a financial or
economic point of view the most important
soil element is nitrogen. First, because it
costs from 18 to 20 cents a pound, while
phosphoric acid can be purchased at five
cents, potash at four cents; and, second, because
of the readiness with which nitrogen
may disappear from the soil under improper
management, either through nitrification
and leaching or by denitrification and
passing back into the air.</p>
<p>Assuming a given type of management,
the question is, How much of the required
nitrogen will be obtained from the legumes
in the cropping system, how much from the
manure, and how much must be purchased
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
in commercial fertilizers? No satisfactory
cropping system can be devised at the present
prices of farm products and cost of
fertilizers for the production of the ordinary
cereals and hay that does not include
the production of some legume. Assuming a
legume in the cropping scheme, the fertility
of the soil may be maintained by yard manure
alone or by commercial fertilizers
alone. Illustrations of both methods are to
be found in actual practice. Generally
speaking, however, the use of yard manure
supplemented with commercial fertilizers
will be found more scientific and in the end
the most economical.</p>
<p>A factor entering into this problem will
be the amount of purchased feed. If considerable
amounts of purchased feeds are
used and the resulting manure carefully preserved
and judiciously applied, the commercial
fertilizers required will be reduced
to the minimum.</p>
<p>A concrete illustration may bring out the
philosophy underlying farm schemes better
than abstract problems.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>The following outline shows a five-course
rotation with the method of fertilization
which the results of the Pennsylvania Station
indicated would be advisable, at least
on limestone soils in eastern United States.</p>

<p>This rotation is suggested for the purpose
of maintaining a farm that is already in a
fairly fertile condition and one on which
there is no considerable amount of purchased
feed. Where concentrates are purchased
liberally, yard manure should be
available to use on the timothy and meadow
in place of the commercial fertilizers.</p>
<p>Where there is plenty of manure and it is
desired to increase the amount of maize and
hay and reduce the amount of oats and
wheat, the following rotation and method of
fertilization would be indicated:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>

</table>

<p>Where there is plenty of yard manure, it
would be also applied to maize under No.
1, or the yard manure could be applied to
maize under No. 1, and commercial fertilizer
applied to timothy under No. 6 could
be repeated under No. 7. If the land is
more or less depleted, an application of 200
pounds of acid phosphate to the oats would
be advisable. However, the purpose is
not to prescribe exact methods, but to point
out underlying principles and their possible
application.</p>
<p>As further illustration, it seems probable
that the practice of a market gardener in
using excessive amounts of stable manure
might, in some instances at least, be modified
to good advantage by reducing the
amount of manure and increasing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
amount of commercial fertilizer used. Unfortunately
there is no experimental evidence
bearing upon this question.</p>
<p>Potash required to maintain fertility is
largely to be found in the coarse fodder,
such as hay, maize stover and silage, and in
the straw used for bedding; hence where
these substances are used in abundance and
returned to the soil the amount of potash
required to be supplied in fertilizers is reduced
to a minimum. Where, however, the
amount of live stock is limited and the
products sold contain large quantities of
potash, such as hay and straw, the supply
furnished in fertilizers must be liberal.</p>
<p>Phosphoric acid is always being slowly
depleted from the soil either from the sale
of farm crops or animal products. There is
no way of returning this loss completely,
except from the addition of a commercial
fertilizer.</p>
<p>The above fertilizer suggestions are based
on the experiments covering a period of
more than 25 years on a limestone soil.
Soils may modify materially the amount
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
and application of the fertilizers, but not
the principles enunciated. For example, a
soil on which common red clover grows
luxuriantly and has a prominent place in the
farm scheme will require less nitrogen in
commercial fertilizers in order to maintain
the fertility than where legumes are raised
with difficulty or do not form a part of the
farm scheme.</p>
<p>One of the most important points to be
emphasized is the fact that haphazard fertilization
is not effective in maintaining soil
fertility. If one starts out to establish a five-course
rotation and build up his soil through
a rational system of fertilization, he will
obviously not obtain the full benefit of the
rotation until he begins to get crops from
the second round, which will be the sixth
year from the beginning. It may happen,
and unfortunately it has perhaps usually
happened in the past, that during the first
rotation the increase in crops has not paid
for the cost of the fertilizers applied. In
many instances a rational system of fertilization
has not been introduced because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
the owner of the land could not afford to
wait six years for his return. Profit in farming,
therefore, does not consist in raising one
big crop or even in obtaining a large balance
on the right side of the ledger in a
single year. It is both interesting and valuable
to know that five tons of timothy hay,
45 bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of maize
and 40 tons of cabbage may be raised on an
acre, but the real profit in farming only
comes through a lifetime of effort. To the
man of capacity who prepares for his work
the results will surely come, but they will
not come all at once and, as in every other
business, he must pay the price in hard work
and close application to details.</p>
<p>In this connection it may be emphasized
that one of the difficulties in successful
farming is to find one man both interested
and capable along the various lines
essential to a successful farm enterprise.
The danger is that a man will
ride his hobby to the detriment of the
other activities of the farm. A farmer
friend of the writer, who keeps a horse and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
buggy, cares so little for a horse that for several
years he has walked two miles each
morning and each evening rather than to
take the trouble to hitch up his horse. If
one visits a high-grade breeder of dairy cattle,
he is very apt to find his pigs of ordinary
character. On the other hand, a specialist
in hogs is likely to keep scrub cows. A man
may be an excellent wheat raiser and a poor
potato grower, and the reverse. The breeder
of live stock is likely to be lacking in his
methods of producing farm crops, while the
up-to-date, so-called general farmer is not
likely to be a special lover of live stock. In
like manner, the man may be a successful
farmer, dairyman or horticulturist from the
producing side, but be a poor salesman. In
fact, those qualities of mind and heart which
make for the best success from the standpoint
of production, whether soil products
or animal products, is not that which makes
the best trader.</p>
<p>It is not expected that the young farmer
will be materially different from his hundreds
of thousands of predecessors, but the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
better a man is trained and the more fully
he studies his own adaptabilities and deficiencies,
the more likely he is to succeed in
the open country. For this reason, the
young man should be careful to get as broad
a training as possible. It is, therefore, often
more important for him to study those
things which he dislikes than to study the
things for which he has a natural taste.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE ROTATION OF CROPS</h3>
</div>

<p>The two essential reasons for a rotation
of crops are: (1) The possibility of
obtaining for the soil a supply of nitrogen
from the air by introducing a legume at
regular intervals, and (2) the prevention of
injury to the crops from fungous diseases,
insect enemies, weeds or other causes. Other
reasons are often advanced, some of which
are entirely erroneous, while others are of
quite secondary importance.</p>
<p>The rotation should be carefully studied
with reference to the farm scheme as previously
outlined. Reasons for modifying
the rotations are: (1) To change the kind
or proportion of crops grown, (2) to change
the amount of labor required, or (3) to increase
the crop-producing power of the soil.</p>
<p>During 25 years the four crops of maize,
oats, wheat, timothy and clover hay have
been taken in rotation from the four tiers
of plats at the Pennsylvania State College,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
so that the influence of the soil has been
entirely eliminated. At the December farm
prices for the decade ending December 1,
1906, the value of these four crops per acre
have been: Maize, $29.67; oats, $14.49;
wheat, $18.49; and hay, $18.05. It will be
noted that during 25 years the average income
from an acre of maize has been almost
exactly twice that from an acre of oats. The
region where these results were obtained is
relatively unfavorable to a large yield of
maize. It is obvious, therefore, that a modification
in the rotation may modify the
average income from the farm materially,
provided such modification does not reduce
the fertility of the soil. Thus, while the
average income per acre during 25 years for
the four-course rotation above mentioned
was $20.17, if the rotation were increased to
a five-course rotation by the addition of another
year of maize, the average income
would be $22.45 an acre.</p>
<p>It may be desirable to modify the rotation
in order to increase or decrease a certain
crop usually fed upon the farm. Thus,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
with a four-course rotation of maize, oats,
wheat, clover and timothy, one-fourth the
area would produce hay; while with a six-course
rotation, composed of maize, oats,
wheat, each one year, and hay three years,
one-half the area would produce hay. If it
is desired to still further reduce the area in
oats and wheat, a seven-course rotation could
be arranged with maize, two years in succession.
This is the rotation that would be
desirable for a dairy farm where it is
planned to keep as many cows as practicable
and to buy the concentrates largely. Either
the wheat or the oats could be taken out of
this rotation if either the one or the other
were thought undesirable and a still greater
amount of roughage desired.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are places where
the minimum amount of roughage is
wanted. There are certain sections of the
central West where it is possible to sow
oats on corn stubble without plowing and
where occasionally a rotation is practiced of
maize, oats and mammoth clover. The
clover is plowed for maize, the oats are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
disked in upon the corn stubble and the
next year the clover is pastured until about
June 1, when it is allowed to go to seed. In
this rotation the only roughage obtained is
the corn stover and the oat straw.</p>
<p>Another result reached by this rotation is
that only one-third the land is plowed annually.
In the four-course rotation mentioned
above three-fourths of the land must
be plowed, while in the six-course rotation
one-half is plowed each year. In other
ways the character of the rotation modifies
the labor. For example, the labor and cost of
harvesting an acre of hay is much less than
that of producing, harvesting and threshing
an acre of wheat.</p>
<p>Rotations may often be planned with
reference to the main or cash crop. Thus in
the Aroostook (Maine) potato district the
rotation is potatoes, oats and clover. The
chief purpose of the oats and clover is to
keep down the blight in potatoes and add
through the clover nitrogen and organic
matter to the soil.</p>
<p>A system of cropping that is best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
when the owner operates the farm may
not be desirable when the farmer is a
tenant. When a farm is rented, the
lease should provide that clover or other
legumes occur with sufficient frequency to
keep up the supply of nitrogen without the
purchase of a considerable quantity in chemical
fertilizers. The lease should be so
drawn as to make it necessary for the tenant
to keep live stock in order to realize the
largest profit. The landlord should provide
an equitable proportion of the mineral
fertilizers when such are required.</p>
<p>The provisions of the lease and the character
of the rotation will necessarily vary
with circumstances, but the following system
of tenant farming which has been employed
for many years in Maryland will
illustrate the principles just stated:</p>
<p>The lease provides for a five-course rotation
consisting of maize, wheat, clover,
wheat, clover. The landlord and the tenant
share the maize and wheat equally, but
the clover for hay or pasture goes entirely
to the tenant, unless hay is sold, when it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
divided equally. They each provide one-half
the commercial fertilizer and one-half
the seed, except clover seed, which the tenant
is required to furnish.</p>
<p>This lease provides for two clover crops
out of every five crops raised, thus supplying
nitrogen abundantly, and the terms of
the lease are such that it is necessary for the
tenant to keep live stock to consume these
clover crops in order to secure the most
profitable returns. The feeding of the
clover makes it necessary to feed some or all
the maize and may lead to buying additional
concentrates.</p>
<p>Stable manure is thereby supplied for the
field which is to raise maize, while mineral
fertilizers may be applied to the fields
sown to wheat. On the limestone soils of
the eastern states 50 pounds each of phosphoric
acid and potash per acre applied to
the wheat, and 10 loads of stable manure per
acre to the maize will probably be found
sufficient to maintain the crop producing
power of the soil.</p>
<p>In laying out a farm for a rotation it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
desirable to plan the number of fields or
tracts that will go in a rotation and try to
get these as nearly equal size as possible.
Having decided upon the number of years
the rotation is to run and having adjusted
the fields or tracts accordingly, it is quite
possible to modify the proportion of crops
by adding one crop and dropping another
at the same time. Thus, if there are six 20-acre
fields, any one of the following rotations
might be used and the change from one
to another easily made:</p>

<p>During the first year the 20-acre field
could be divided into four tracts of five
acres each, containing potatoes, cabbage,
tomatoes and sweet corn, and then followed
for four or five years by any succession of
crops above outlined. The point is that a
definite adjustment of the farm to some general
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
method of rotation and a definite system
of fertilization and soil renovation do
not prevent a considerable latitude in the
crops raised. It will be obvious that the
longer the rotation the more flexible it becomes
in this particular, which is a point
to be considered in laying out the farm and
in adjusting fields and fences.</p>
<p>In some cases it may be desirable on account
of the arrangement of the farm or the
character of the crops to be raised to have
two distinct rotations of crops. For example,
if the farm lends itself to be divided into
eight tracts, a five-course rotation of maize,
oats, wheat, each one year, and clover and
timothy two years, and a three-course rotation
of potatoes, oats or wheat and clover
may be arranged.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE EQUIPMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>The workman is known by his tools.
The problem of obtaining the most
efficient machinery for the conduct of the
farm without having an excessive amount is
not easy of solution.</p>
<p>It is probable that the cost of maintaining
machinery and tools is not less than 15%,
10% for upkeep and 5% for interest, even
under the most careful management. Doubtless
in practice it is as much as 25%. If this
is conceded there must be a limit to the
amount which may be economically invested
in equipment. This is a place where
the lead pencil may be used profitably. For
example, if $125 is invested in a self-binder,
the annual cost of the machine at 15% will
be $18.75. If one has but 15 acres of grain
to harvest, it may be better to hire
a self-binder at $1 an acre. On the other
hand, it may be necessary to own a self-binder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
in order to get the grain harvested at
the proper time.</p>
<p>Among the machines requiring a considerable
investment for the number of days
used may be mentioned hay loaders, hay tedders,
corn-binding harvesters and lime
spreaders. There is a certain class of labor-saving
devices, however, for which there is
more or less constant need, as, for example,
means of pumping water, methods of
handling manure, both from the stable to
the manure shed, and from the manure shed
to the field. This leads to the remark that
there is at present great need of modifying
our traditional ideas concerning farm barns.
Why do persons usually sleep on the second
floor, while horses and cattle are placed in
the basement? Three things have brought
about the need of a radical revision of our
practices concerning the planning of barns:
(1) Our present knowledge of the difference
in the function of food in keeping the
animal warm, and that of producing work,
flesh or milk; (2) the discovery of the
bacillus of tuberculosis; and (3) the invention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
of the hay carrier. It is not the purpose
here to discuss barn buildings, but
merely to call attention to the fact that the
traditional barn has long since outlived its
usefulness, and that the young farmer should
plan his farm buildings to serve the purposes
required in the light of modern
knowledge.</p>
<p>Various attempts have been made to manufacture
combined machines; that is, a machine
which, by an interchange of parts or
other modification, may be used for two or
more purposes, as, for example, harvesting
small grain and cutting grass. Such attempts
have usually been unsuccessful. On
the other hand, the young farmer should
consider the range of usefulness of any given
type of machine or tool; thus, a disk harrow
is more efficient for some purposes than a
spring-tooth harrow. For other purposes
the spike-tooth harrow is better than the
spring tooth. The spring-tooth harrow,
however, will do fairly well wherever the
disk harrow or the spike-tooth harrow is
needed. When, therefore, only one of these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
tools can be afforded, the spring tooth may
be a better tool to buy than either the disk or
the spike-tooth, although it is not for certain
purposes as efficient as either of the others.</p>
<p>The kind of machine should obviously be
adjusted to the conditions, as, for example,
the size of the farm, and the character of the
farming. Riding plows may be desirable
on level land, but where it is necessary to
plow up and down hill, walking plows
should be used. The extra weight of the
wheel plow is not a serious matter on level
land, because the sliding friction has been
transferred to rolling friction, but no
mechanical device has been or can be invented
which will decrease the power
necessary to raise a given weight a given
height. The various machines requiring
horse power should be adjusted, as far as
possible, to require the same number of
horses. If the main unit is three horses,
then, as far as possible, all machines should
require three horses, such as plows, harrows,
manure spreaders, harvesters, etc. If the
activities of the farm are sufficient to require
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
six horses then some of the tools may require
three horses each, while others require a
pair.</p>

</div>

<p>A farm with six work horses is rather a
desirable one from several aspects. Among
other things, it enables the farm owner to
employ two men who can perform most of
the team work with two three-horse teams,
while at other times three pairs of horses
may be arranged when the owner needs to
use a team. This leaves the farmer time to
attend to many activities not requiring
horses, and time to plan the work and to
look with more care after the purchases and
sales. The size of such a farm will depend
entirely on the nature of the activities. If it
is a so-called general farm with a minimum
of live stock, it would, perhaps, consist of
from 150 to 180 acres of tillable land with
some additional pasture and woodland.
Ideally, every farm should have sufficient
activity to make it something of a center. It
should be an organism. It is difficult to
organize one man.</p>
<p>It will be useful, when we come to discuss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
how profits may be estimated, to divide the
capital into three general groups: (1) The
plant, which in addition to the real estate,
will include the machines and tools, horses
used for labor, and other animals used for
breeding purposes or for the production of
animal products, such as butter, wool or
eggs; (2) materials, which will include
animals which are to be fattened for sale,
and all seeds, fertilizers and foods intended
to be turned into products to be sold; (3)
supplies, which may include foods for
teams, and money with which to pay labor,
be this labor that of the farmer or his employees.</p>
<p>The purpose of this classification is to
bring sharply into view the fact that the
nature of different kinds of equipment
varies. All the things named under the plant
are in the nature of an annual charge against
income. The charge under materials may
or may not be an annual charge. If a man
invests $2,000 in 50 head of cattle, which he
intends to feed and sell for $3,250 at the end
of one hundred days, he does not have to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
calculate interest on $2,000 for a year, but
only for 100 days. Cattle paper is held in
large quantities by banks in the cattle feeding
districts of the United States. The
farmer would, in fact, be unwise to keep
$2,000 in the bank nine months in the year
in order to use it three months. Like any
other business man, if he has the money, he
invests it and borrows the money to buy his
cattle. The same thing applies to food and
fertilizers. If the food is fed to cattle, some
of the money invested in the food must pay
interest during the fattening period. Food
fed to dairy cattle and chickens may be paid
for out of each days income. In practice,
the amount of money invested in food for
dairy cattle and chickens is dependent only
upon the most economical unit of purchase.
One may apply fertilizers to buckwheat,
give a three months note for the
fertilizer, and pay the note out of the
proceeds of the crop. If the fertilizer is
applied to one-year-old apple trees, this investment
may be required to pay interest for
fifteen years.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>The same principle applies to supplies.
If one starts into raising horses for sale, he
needs to have some money or other income
on which his laborers and his own family
can live, say for five years, this being the
age at which a horse is supposed to become
salable. More people would raise apples
and horses if they could afford to wait for
the return on the investment.</p>
<p>While this is a serious handicap, it is an
advantage to the man who arranges his
farming methods so that he can secure an
income from some other source in the interim.
The young farmer will do wisely to
so arrange his farm methods that a portion,
perhaps the major portion of his farm, will
give him quick returns while making
some long-time investments, which later in
life will give him a greater return because
so few people are sufficiently forehanded to
make them.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>HOW TO ESTIMATE PROFITS</h3>
</div>

<p>No man who engages in manufacturing
or merchandising knows how much
he is going to make annually during life.
Much less does he know how much he will
be worth when he dies. Neither does the
man who works for a salary or practices
some profession for fees know what his
annual income will be even during the following
decade. Neither one nor the other
knows whether he will die a millionaire or a
pauper. It is a problem too complex for
any human mind to analyze. It is less certain
than what the weather will be on this
day next year, because it is the resultant of
more variable factors.</p>
<p>In some respects there is more hazard in
farming than in manufacturing or in merchandising,
while in other respects there is
much less. The profit which may be obtained
from farming is neither easier nor
more difficult to estimate than is that of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
other commercial enterprises. However,
there is no business in which more foolish
estimates are made as to the probable profits,
except, perhaps, in mining.</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is not to give
advice as to possible or probable profits, but
rather to point out the general character of
the data required for any individual problem,
where the data may be obtained and
how it may be applied.</p>
<p>There are two forms or methods of stating
the financial gain that has been obtained
from farming or other business ventures
during a year or other specific period. The
first may be called the interest on the investment
method, and the second the labor income
method.</p>
<p>With the interest on the investment
method, all expenses may be subtracted
from all the sales. From the cash balance
thus obtained the increase or decrease in
inventory may be added or subtracted. This
balance may then be divided by the capital
invested, to determine the rate of interest
received.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>The rate of interest method is the usual
method in the commercial world. The
prosperity of the railroad or industrial concern
is judged by the rate of interest it pays
its stockholders on the par value of the
stock. The stock itself takes on the capitalization
in accordance with the present and
prospective dividends. The fact that this
method is generally used in the commercial
world is evidence that it is well suited to its
needs.</p>
<p>The young farmer who wishes to know
whether the operation of a given tract of
land in a certain manner offers him a worthy
opportunity will not find the interest on the
investment method the best suited for his
purpose. This is especially true when applied
to a single product. For example, it
may be shown that 50 hens will, when
properly managed, in connection with other
farm enterprises, return a remarkable interest
on the capital employed. It does not follow,
however, that a man can make a living
with fifty hens or even 500 hens. If a man
has an investment of $5,000, on which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
obtains 10 per cent, his income would be
$500. If, on the other hand, he has an investment
of $25,000 and obtains a return of
only 6%, his income is $1,500, or three
times the former amount. In neither case,
however, does this form of statement tell a
man how much of his income is due to his
brain and brawn and how much to the capital
invested.</p>
<p>What the young farmer wishes to know is
how much will he receive for his own time,
energy and skill, after deducting all expenses
and a reasonable interest charge on
his investment&mdash;such a rate of interest as he
could get by placing his money in good
securities or what he would be required to
pay for his capital if he borrowed it. This
is best obtained by the labor income method.
With this method all expenses are subtracted
from all sales and to the cash balance
thus obtained is added or subtracted
the increase or decrease in the inventory.
This balance may be called the farm income.
Thus far the procedure is just the
same as the interest on the investment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
method. From the farm income is now subtracted
a reasonable interest on the investment,
the balance remaining is called the
labor income. This is the return which the
farmer has obtained by and for his own
efforts. If this balance is zero, then he
should change his methods or get into some
other business.</p>
<p>This statement of his income, whatever
it may be, enables him to compare his prosperity
with that of the man who is employed
upon a salary. Here, again, however, it is
difficult to make comparisons because of the
differences in expenses of living. The chief
difference, however, in the expense of the
wage earner in the city and the farmer is in
the matter of house rent. For example, if
the wage earner pays $300 a year house rent
that must be deducted from his income in
comparing it with the labor income of the
farmer. It is often stated that the farmer
also has his living from the farm. This was
much more true formerly than it is at present.
Under present methods of distributing
food products and with modern types of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
farming, the amount of food supplied the
table from the farm is comparatively small.
The rancher in Montana eats foods canned
in Maine or Delaware, while the New
Hampshire farmer buys his vegetables from
Boston commission merchants. The Minnesota
farmer cannot supply his breakfast
table with oranges, grapefruit or oatmeal.
Many of them buy, if not their bread, at
least their flour, and also their butter. The
fact that the city man indulges in high living
is no argument in favor of the country
man expecting less wages. Some of those
things which are necessary to make the
country an ideal place to live are expensive.
Some of them are more expensive to obtain
in the country than in the city, as, for example,
educational facilities. In justifying
his purchase of an automobile, a young
farmer recently stated that his wife had certain
cares, responsibilities and even privations
which her city friends did not have.
He thought that the automobile would help
to offset them.</p>
<p>To my mind there is no more ideal place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
to live and rear a family than in the open
country when the conditions are what they
should be and may be. I believe, however,
it is well to insist that it costs something to
live in the country as well as in the city if
one lives as well as every farmer has a right
to expect to live.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the steps necessary
in order to arrive at a fair estimate of the
labor income. To make the matter concrete,
we will assume a farm of 200 acres
worth $60 an acre located in central Pennsylvania
on a limestone clay loam soil over
1,000 feet above sea level. This farm is to
contain 20 acres of timber, a 30-acre apple
orchard two years old, 40 acres of pasture,
96 acres of cultivated land divided into six
16-acre fields. The rest of the 200 acres
consists of small yards, roadways and waste
land. One-half of each of the six 16-acre
fields is to consist of a rotation of maize, oats
and wheat, each one year, and hay three
years, the latter clover and timothy followed
by timothy. The other half is to consist of
maize, barley, followed by alfalfa four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
years. In the young orchard there will be
grown for a few years potatoes, tomatoes,
cabbages and garden peas. After the
orchard attains a size which forbids these
intertilled crops, a portion of the pasture
may be broken up so that these market garden
crops may be raised. There will be
kept six horses, 20 milch cows, 20 ewes of
some mutton breed of sheep, five brood sows
and 50 hens.</p>
<p>First of all, let attention be called to the
broad knowledge of farming required to
operate this moderate-sized and comparatively
simple farm. The crops to be raised
are maize, oats, wheat, clover, alfalfa, timothy,
potatoes, tomatoes, cabbages, garden
peas and apples. The animal products sold
will be chiefly butter fat, wool, mutton, veal,
pork and eggs. This is neither a long nor
complex list of products. They are all
adapted to the farm which the writer has in
mind. Yet the man who operates this farm
to the highest success will need to have a
knowledge of agronomy, or the raising of
field crops, of horticulture, animal husbandry,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
including poultry husbandry and
dairying. He needs to have a good understanding
of the principles of agricultural
chemistry, to have a knowledge of how to
prevent and combat fungous diseases and
insect enemies. To get the most out of his
timber land he should know at least some of
the first principles of forestry, and if he has
gained some instruction in the study of landscape
gardening, his home will be more
attractive, and his farm a source of greater
pleasure to him.</p>
<p>To proceed with the estimate, the first
thing to be done is to make a record of the
cropping system, giving the areas and the
estimated production of each crop. How
is the yield per acre to be determined?
Clearly, one cannot afford to estimate his
profits on the basis of some unusual yields.
If one could be assured of 40 bushels of
wheat, 60 bushels of oats, five tons of hay,
300 bushels of potatoes, or 200 bushels of
apples per acre, or 500 pounds of butter fat
per cow, or 150 eggs per hen per year, there
would be no difficulty about obtaining a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
snug labor income. Such results are
possible and are appropriate ideals for
which to strive, but are not safe as estimates
on which to do business.</p>
<p>The year books of the United States Department
of Agriculture contain the annual
estimate of the yields, and the average December
farm price of staple crops by states.
These figures may serve as a basis for making
estimates. If the natural conditions are
about the average stated, one may properly
assume that he can obtain an increase of
50%. He may even hope to double the yield,
although it is not safe to assume such an increase
in making an estimate of profits. If
the natural conditions are more favorable or
less favorable than the average, he must take
the fact into consideration in his estimates.
In the same way he may consider whether
the average December farm price represents
fairly his expectation of the price, or
whether because of favorable location or
superior quality of the article purchased he
can expect higher remuneration.</p>
<p>It is here assumed that the young farmer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
is himself going to be more than an average
farmer. If he is not he will only get average
results, in which case his labor income
will be only that of the ordinary day
laborer.</p>
<p>To repeat the idea in concrete terms. If
the young farmer is located in central Pennsylvania
and finds that the average yield of
wheat for the state is 17 bushels an acre, he
may safely estimate that his improved
methods will bring him 25 bushels of wheat
to the acre. He may even hope for 34
bushels per acre. At the Pennsylvania station
several varieties of wheat have, during
the past 18 years, averaged over 30 bushels
per acre. One year one variety produced
43 bushels. It would not be safe, however,
to use such figures in estimating profits.</p>
<p>Having outlined the cropping system and
made a careful estimate of the total annual
production of each crop, the next step is to
determine the amount of food and bedding
required for the live stock. From this data
it may be determined what products will be
available for sale, and what foodstuffs must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
be bought. Thus, it may be found, for example,
that the amount of oats raised just
meets the requirement, while more maize
must be purchased, together with nitrogenous
concentrates, and that a portion of the
hay is available for sale. In the farm under
consideration there will, of course, be wheat,
potatoes, tomatoes, cabbages, garden peas
and the animal products previously mentioned
for sale, and later there will be
apples and some lumber from the wood lot.</p>
<p>The data are now at hand by which to estimate
the total receipts. Having made the
estimates of receipts, the expenses are estimated,
and the difference gives the cash
balance, if there is any. The most important
items of expense will be labor, feed, seeds,
fertilizers, harvesting and threshing expenses,
spraying material, shipping packages,
blacksmithing and repairs. After all
expenses that can be thought of are included
not less than 10% should be added for incidental
expenses.</p>
<p>The amount of commercial or natural
fertilizers to be purchased is, of course,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
related to the yard manure which will be
produced on the farm; therefore some estimate
of the probable amount is desirable.
In a roughly empirical way the amount of
manure produced may be estimated at twice
the amount of dry food and bedding used,
provided it is hauled daily to the field.
Where stored and drawn to the field at
stated periods, the shrinkage in weight,
although not necessarily in plant food, may
be as much as one-half.</p>
<p>The estimate of what the inventory should
be at the beginning and end of the year is
not so simple a matter as it may at first seem
to be. The purpose of taking the inventory
is twofold: First, to determine whether the
inventory has increased or decreased, and
second, to determine on what amount of capital
interest is to be calculated. For
example, one must carry forward each year
seed for the next years crop. Feed must be
carried over to feed live stock until other
food becomes available, and there must be
money on hand with which to pay for labor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
unless there is a cash income from the sale
of products sufficient to care for the labor
bills.</p>
<p>In the case of the farm under consideration
there is a young orchard of about one
thousand trees. This orchard is not bringing
in any income, but there is a constant
expenditure of money on it, and a constant
increase in its value. While, therefore, it
decreases the cash income it increases the
farm income and the labor income. On the
other hand, it increases the interest charges
because the plant or farm is increasing in
value. How much will it increase in value?
In some sections it is customary to consider
that an orchard increases in value $1 per
tree per year. If this is a correct estimate,
this 1,000-tree orchard will increase the
value of the farm $1,000 a year until it
comes into full bearing. The farm under
consideration was purchased two years ago
for $9,500. On the assumption just stated,
at the end of 15 years from date of purchase
this farm should be worth $25,000, at least
$15,000 of which will be due to a 30-acre
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
orchard. This is at the rate of $500 an acre
for the orchard itself.</p>
<p>In order to bring out some of the phases
of the inventory more clearly the following
classification of items is given below:</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.5em; margin-top:1em;'>INVENTORY</p>
</div>

<div class='la'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A. Plant.</span></p>
<div style='margin-top:1em'></div>
<p>The real estate, 200 acres at $60 per acre.</p>
<p>The live stock.</p>
<p style=' margin-left:1em;'>  Work horses and breeding stock.</p>

<p>Seeds, potatoes, oats, maize, wheat.</p>
<p>Feed, hay for cattle and sheep, silage for cows, maize for</p>
<p style=' margin-left:1em;'>  pigs.</p>
<p>Growing wheat, 8 acres at $6 per acre.</p>
<p>Live stock, calves, lambs and pigs.</p>
<div style='margin-top:1em'></div>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>C. Supplies.</span></p>
<div style='margin-top:1em'></div>
<p>Hay and oats for horses.</p>
<p>Money for current expenses.</p>
</div>

<p>In estimating the inventory at the end of
the year, a deduction should be made for the
decrease in the value of the live stock under
the plant and also for the machinery. Perhaps
5% for the live stock and 10% for the
machinery and tools will be a fair deduction.
Under materials and supplies those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
items have been inventoried which are to be
carried over each year from the preceding
year. In the case of seeds the amount
required must be deducted from the amount
sold, or they must appear as a charge in the
expense account. Ordinarily they are carried
over from year to year and thus become
a part of the permanent investment. Since
on the farm under consideration there is a
considerable monthly income from the sale
of butter fat and eggs, it may be possible
that no allowance will be needed in the
inventory for current expenses, although it
is always desirable to carry a bank account
in order to be able to make favorable purchases
when opportunity offers.</p>
<p>As a part of the work in a course in farm
management, the writer asked each student
to secure the financial history of an actual
farm covering a period of three years. The
financial history of 30 farms during the
years 1901 to 1903, inclusive, and 28 farms
during the years 1902-1904, inclusive, was
thus obtained and is given herewith.

<p>These figures show the application of
principles enunciated in this chapter. A
careful reader will have no difficulty in
recognizing how the different items have
been obtained. For example, the difference
between the receipts and disbursements in
the first column gives the cash balance of
$1,706. The farm income, $2,055, is obtained
by adding to the cash balance $349,
which is the annual increase in the capital.
The labor income is obtained by subtracting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
from the farm income the interest on the
capital at five per cent. The amount of
capital is determined by dividing by two
the sum of the inventories at the beginning
and end of the period.<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C"></a><a href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>
<p>It will be noted that the gross receipts,
the expenses, the farm income and the labor
income on these actual farms are all more
closely related to the capital invested than
the size of the farm. Thus, on the 30 farms
with a capitalization of about $13,500, the
average yearly receipts were about $25 an
acre, while on the 28 farms with a capitalization
of about $8,300, the average yearly
receipts were about $16 an acre. Likewise
on the high-priced farms the labor income
was approximately $10 an acre, while on the
lower priced ones it was about $7.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>GRAIN AND HAY FARMING</h3>
</div>

<p>An important and primary factor in the
production of all wealth is labor.
Aside from the professional and domestic
classes, the people of the world devote themselves
to three forms of work: (1) Changes
in substance, or natural products; (2)
changes in form, or mechanical products;
(3) changes in place, or exchange of products.
The second of these forms of work
gives rise to manufacturing; the third, to
trade and commerce. Under the first sub-division
two classes of natural products may
be recognized; first, what, for want of a
better name, may be called chemical
products, such as ores, coal and salt, from
which are derived mining and the metallurgical
arts; and second, vital products, or,
in other words, vegetation and animals. It
is work applied to the production of vegetation
and animals that gives rise to agriculture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
Agriculture is labor applied to the
production of living things.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>KINDS OF AGRICULTURE</p>
</div>

<p>The industries which deal with the production
of living things may be divided,
theoretically, largely on the basis of the
character of the results, but to some extent
upon the nature of the activities involved.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g0017.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
</div>

<p>The manner in which this theoretical
classification has worked out in actual practice
will be indicated in some measure by
the inquiries of the United States Census
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
Bureau. The twelfth census has classified
farms on the basis of their principal income.
If 40% or more of the gross income of the
farm was from dairy products, it was called
a dairy farm; if from live stock, a live stock
farm; if from cotton, a cotton farm. If no
product constituted 40% of the gross
receipts, the farm was classified as a miscellaneous
or general farm.</p>
<p>In 1900 there were 5,740,000 farms in
the United States, which were, according to
the rule just stated, classified as follows:</p>

<p>Including miscellaneous or general
farms, there are just a dozen kinds of farms
mentioned. Of this number, nine kinds
obtained at least 40% of their products, and
probably much more, from vegetable rather
than from animal forms. However, live
stock and dairy farms constitute about one-third
of the total number of farms, and
almost one-half the farm acreage. There
are four kinds of farms on which the production
of grain and hay forms an important
part of their activities; namely, the hay
and grain farm, the live stock farm, the
dairy farm, and general farm. These constitute,
in the aggregate, 75% of the farms
of the United States, and by virtue of their
larger area, they occupy 85% of the total
farm area.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>GRAIN AND HAY STATISTICS</p>
</div>

<p>At the close of the nineteenth century less
than one-half the area of the United States
was owned in farms. Only one-half of this
farm area was considered to be under cultivation.
The total area in cereals was one-tenth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
the total land area, while 3% was
devoted to hay and 2% to all other crops
except pasture.</p>
<p>Without going into details, it may be
stated with reasonable assurance that: (1)
During the last half of the last century, the
production of cereals has increased much
faster than the population. For example,
in 1850, there were raised in the United
States one ton of cereal grains per capita;
by 1900 this amount had increased to one
and one-half tons for each inhabitant.</p>
<p>(2) Since the number of persons engaged
in agriculture has decreased in proportion
to population, the quantity of cereals produced
in proportion to persons engaged in
agriculture has increased in still greater
ratio. So far, therefore, as the amount of
cereals is concerned, the farmer has been
getting an increasingly larger return for his
labor.</p>
<p>(3) The quantity of cereals has increased
in proportion to the arable land. This may
be due to one or more of three causes: (a)
greater average yield per acre; (b) greater
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
proportion of cereals to other crops; or (c)
to a change in the ratio of the different
cereal crops. The following table, giving
the average yield of grain, reduced to
pounds per acre, shows not only how the
substitution of one cereal for another might
affect the total production of cereal grains,
but also suggests to the young farmer how
he may modify the total product of his
farm:</p>

<p>Yields will vary relatively in different
regions and with different types of soil, and
should be studied with reference to ones
conditions.</p>
<p>(4) The wheat and oat crops have increased
about six and one-half times in 50
years, the hay crop five and one-half times,
while maize has increased four and one-half
times. Cotton, the only other great staple
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
crop, has increased four times in the same
period. The oat crop has increased the
most rapidly of any since 1880. It is interesting,
and may be significant, to note that,
while the production of wheat and barley in
Great Britain has decreased about one-half
in thirty years, the production of oats has
increased somewhat.</p>
<p>(5) The greatest rate of increase in the
production of cereals in the United States
during the last half century has taken place
since 1870. This increase is coincident with
three other facts of the utmost importance:
(a) The development of the central West,
a treeless plain&mdash;prior to this period much
of the farm land in the United States had
been hewn out of the forest, tree by tree;
(b) the consolidation of the steam railways
into transcontinental lines; and (c) the introduction
of the self-binding harvester.
Formerly it took at least five men to do what
is done today by one man in the harvesting
of cereals.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>ADVANTAGES OF GRAIN FARMING</p>
</div>

<p>(1) The cost of land excepted, the production
of hay and grain requires a small
outlay of money. During the past fifty
years, many thousands of persons have been
able to obtain farms of 160 acres at almost
no cost. With a few hundred dollars invested
in horses and tools with which to
plow the prairie and sow the seed, these
fortunate persons have oftentimes been able
to pay the whole of their expenses, capital
included, from the first crop. The renter
who operates a hay and grain farm usually
has but a small capital invested in his business.</p>
<p>(2) The cereals bring a quick return.
Wheat may be sown in September and sold
in July; maize may be planted in May and
sold in November; oats may be planted in
April and sold in August. The short period
between seed time and harvest makes the
oat crop a favorite one among renters. On
the other hand, it takes from three to seven
years to produce a marketable horse. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
may take ten to fifteen years to begin to realize
on an apple orchard.</p>
<p>(3) The products are not easily perishable,
and hence can be held almost
indefinitely. The development of the magnificent
elevator system, based upon the
principle that the cereals can be handled
like water, greatly simplifies the holding
and preservation of these staple products.</p>
<p>(4) The products are in constant demand,
and hence they always find a market.</p>
<p>Agricultural commodities may be divided
into three classes, depending upon the area
which controls the price of the commodity,
as follows: (a) price units world-wide, as
wheat, cotton, pork; (b) price units local to
large districts&mdash;products too bulky to ship
long distances&mdash;such as hay, potatoes and

small areas, such as strawberries and green
vegetables. It is obvious that the larger the
area which controls the price, the more
constant will be the demand.

<p>OBJECTIONS TO GRAIN FARMING</p>
</div>

<p>(1) It exhausts the soil. About two-thirds
of the wheat of the United States is
consumed outside the county in which it
is raised.</p>
<p>(2) It requires a large quantity of land
to produce a competence. Land must be
low in price, or the interest on the money
invested in the land will consume the
profits. The relation of crop to income is
suggested by comparing the gross returns
from an acre of potatoes or tobacco with
an acre of maize. The average gross income
during a decade was, from an acre of
maize, $9.50; an acre of potatoes, $38;
and from an acre of tobacco, $61.50.</p>
<p>(3) Only such part of the land as is
suited to tillage can be used.</p>
<p>(4) The marketing of cereals requires
the transportation of bulky products. Hay
is handicapped much more seriously. The
distance a product can be shipped depends
somewhat on the price per pound received
for it. If it costs one cent a pound to ship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
maize to a grain market, obviously it cannot
be transported without loss when it brings
only 50 cents a bushel. On the other hand,
two cents a pound may easily be paid for
shipping butter which is worth 25 cents a
pound. The transportation of $2,000 worth
of maize to a railway station ten miles distant
is a laborious and expensive operation,
but when this same maize is turned into
beef or pork, it will transport itself to the
station with comparatively little trouble.
Notwithstanding the excellent transportation
facilities which the farmers of the
United States enjoy, 80% of the maize is
consumed in the county in which it is raised.
Cereal production demands better transportation
facilities than cotton farming,
tobacco growing or the rearing of domestic
animals.</p>
<p>(5) Capital must lie idle much of the
time. The self-binding harvester or the hay
rake is only used a few weeks, or perhaps
more often only a few days, each year. A
cream separator or a churn may be used
every day in the year. In the first instance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
there is not only interest on unemployed capital,
but the capital is actually deteriorating
through nonuse.</p>
<p>(6) The production of hay and grain
does not give continuous employment. The
slightest consideration of the following
table must show that unless live stock is
kept, there are considerable periods of the
year in which very little labor is required,
while at other times considerable work is
necessary to prevent loss.</p>

<p>(7) Much depends upon natural forces.
While there is opportunity for the use of
knowledge and judgment in the production
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
of high-grade seeds and even of large yields,
there is not the same scope for skill that
there is in some other lines of agricultural
enterprise. Skill means the capacity to do
something difficult, and the more effort
required to produce an object the more
value it has, provided its utility is unlimited.
The farming which requires the most
skill pays the best if one has the skill to
apply to it. This is because those who do
not have the requisite skill are usually unsuccessful.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE COST OF FARMING OPERATIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>Several millions of the inhabitants of
the United States, not to mention those
of other countries, are engaged each year in
the preparation of the soil for the cereal and
forage crops and on the work of seeding and
harvesting them. The welfare of one-third
the population is directly and that of
the other two-thirds, although less directly,
is quite as surely dependent upon the effectiveness
of this effort. If, for example, as
sometimes happens, one-third the population
receives on account of untoward seasonal
conditions but four-fifths of the usual
product, everyone must suffer on account of
this unrewarded labor. Many, perhaps
most, financial panics have their origin in
crop failures aided, doubtless, by an improper
financial system.</p>
<p>Although widely and sometimes bitterly
discussed, little is really known concerning
the relation between the effort expended and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
the returns obtained in producing the great
staple farm products; yet one of the most
important and vital considerations in the
organization of a farm enterprise is the income,
both gross and net, which may be
expected from the different crops contemplated.
Obviously the yield and price of
the several crops will vary with the locality
and with the season. It is, therefore, impossible
to predict for any year either what
yield may be obtained or what price will be
secured. If, however, a sufficient number
of years are selected, an average may be
found which will form a basis for calculating
the probable result for another series of
years. The following table gives the yield
and the average farm values per acre for
five staple crops for five years, 1905-1909
inclusive, for the United States and for four
widely separated states, viz., Pennsylvania,
Iowa, Texas and Oregon.</p>

<p>Such figures as the above may be compiled
by anyone at any time for any year or
series of years from the yearbooks of the
United States Department of Agriculture.
They form a fairly sound basis for calculating
the gross income which may be expected
from the staple farm crops, particularly for
the cereals, potatoes, hay, cotton and
tobacco. Five questions, however, present
themselves, which should, as far as possible,
be settled before applying them to an
individual problem.</p>
<p>(1) How nearly do the conditions, especially
those of soil and climate, of the given
location correspond to the averages of the
state? The question can be settled only by
a thorough study of soils and their crop
adaptation. It is a matter requiring study,
experience and judgment.</p>
<p>(2) How much larger yields may be expected
on account of better methods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
employed? It is here that most mistakes are
made in estimating possible farm profits.
Necessarily, all statistical averages of production
are much below those which an enterprising
farmer considers an average crop
and habitually produces. Not more than
50% increase upon these figures, however,
should be anticipated by reason of the improved
methods which one is going to
employ.</p>
<p>While the average yield of maize, even in
the so-called corn states, is not far from 30
bushels an acre, and while it is quite common
for good farmers to produce 60 to 75
bushels of maize per acre, it would not be
safe to assume a yield of more than 45 bushels
unless the conditions are more than
ordinarily favorable.</p>
<p>The application of the averages given on
pages
<a href="#page_149">149-150</a>
to an individual farm enterprise
may be illustrated by calculating the
possible results which might be obtained
on 80 acres of arable land in Iowa and
Pennsylvania with the four great soil products
of northern United States.

<p>If 50% is added for the increased yields
which may be expected on account of the
employment of better methods, the total
yield from 80 acres of arable land would
become for Iowa $1,428 and for Pennsylvania
$2,169. This does not mean that
farming is necessarily more profitable in
Pennsylvania than in Iowa. Not only
may the cost of cultivating an acre of
arable land be greater in Pennsylvania,
but usually a larger territory must be
owned in order to obtain 80 acres
of arable land. Eighty acres of these
four crops is probably as often grown on a
farm of 100 acres in Iowa as on one of 160
acres in Pennsylvania. The total farm
acreage in Iowa is, in round numbers, 35
millions; in Pennsylvania, 19 millions. In
Iowa about one-half the farm area is in the

<p>An examination of the last column shows
that the average price of these staple farm
products has been considerably greater during
five recent years than during the
previous thirty years. Will this increase in
price continue, or will there be a series of
years of unusually low prices which will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
bring the average price of the decade down
to that of the previous three decades? Few
persons will care to venture an answer to
this question, which is of the utmost importance
to all farmers and especially to
the beginner.</p>
<p>(4) The figures employed are taken from
the yearbook of the United States Department
of Agriculture and are the estimated
farm price on December 1 of each year.
Can the commodities be sold for the December
farm price? Will potatoes sold at the
time of digging bring less than the
December price? Will wheat or maize
held until May bring a higher price? To
what extent, by the judicious holding of
products, can advance in price be obtained?</p>
<p>(5) Will the products be sold for cash,
or may they be turned into animal products
at an increased profit? In some sections of
the United States animals are reared
primarily because of the increased profit
due to manufacturing soil products into
animal products; in other regions, however,
they are kept primarily for the purpose of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
maintaining the fertility of the soil and only
incidentally on account of the increased
profits.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>COST OF PRODUCTION</p>
</div>

<p>For a number of reasons it is difficult to
determine the cost of growing farm crops.
One reason deserves to be especially emphasized.
In any business enterprise it may
be necessary to run at a loss, because to stop
would entail a still greater loss. This is particularly
true in farming, where men are
employed by the month in order that they
may be had when needed. Since they are
receiving pay, it is better that such men
should be employed some days at farm
operations which return only a portion of
their wages rather than not to have them
employed at all. Under such circumstances,
therefore, the cost of producing a
given crop may be greater than is indicated
by the time actually employed in its
production.</p>
<p>Many other factors also enter, as the
average number of hours per day which it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
is possible to work. This is greatly influenced
by weather conditions. The Minnesota
station determined that the working
day on about thirty farms in that state
varied from seven and one-half to eight and
one-half hours, with two to three and one-half
hours on Sunday. The average length
of the working day for horses varied from
3.1 to 3.3 hours.</p>
<p>The cost for labor of cultivating a given
area of land will depend not only on the
crop or crops to be raised, the climate, the
topography and character of the soil, the
size and shape of the fields and the system
of cropping, but also upon the mans ability
for organization. It is said that the
European farmers, and even the farmers
from eastern Canada, are several years in
adjusting themselves to farming in western
Canada. When the farmers from Iowa,
Kansas, Nebraska or surrounding states
move into western Canada with their three-horse
teams and other suitable equipment,
applying their thorough knowledge of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
prairie farming, they are at once successful.
The man is thus an important factor.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>TIME REQUIRED FOR CULTURAL OPERATIONS</p>
</div>

<p>The following table will be helpful as
showing time required to perform certain
operations, since it is a record of labor actually
employed on a field of 18 acres of
easily tilled land in central Ohio. All labor
was employed at prices named, board for
man and food for horses being furnished in
addition at the prices estimated. The owner
of the land furnished the horse for the
harvester.</p>

<p>Some years ago the writer made an estimate
of the cost of producing maize, oats,
wheat and clover hay in a four-course
rotation on a tenant farm in central Pennsylvania.
The soil was a heavy clay and
required plowing for each crop, except, of
course, the hay crop, one acre a day being
considered a good days work.</p>
<p>Counting the expense of man and team at
$2 per day, the labor cost per acre was
found to be $7 for maize, $5.10 for both
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
wheat and oats, and $2.30 for hay, or an
average of about $4.90 per acre for the four
crops. The interest on the capital invested
in operating this farm, exclusive of the land,
was estimated at $1.45 per acre.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE PLACE OF INTENSIVE<br />FARMING</h3>
</div>

<p>The doctrine of the survival of the most
fit applies equally to the field of biology
and to the field of economics. The general
introduction of vegetables and fruits
into the human dietary has, by banishing the
loathsome diseases of the Middle Ages,
greatly increased human efficiency. It follows
that those peoples or nations who
employ vegetables and fruits in abundance,
other things being equal, will be most fit to
survive and must outstrip others less fortunately
situated. We may for this reason
alone look forward to the increasing importance
of vegetable growing and fruit
raising; but there is a more obvious and
perhaps more direct reason. There is in the
production of vegetables, at least, a method
of satisfying the dietetic needs of an increasing
population. The employment of a part
of the area now in cereals and forage crops
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
for the production of potatoes, cabbages,
legumes, roots and tomatoes is one of the
most ready means of increasing the food
supply. Whether such substitution will be
advantageous to the human race depends,
however, not so much upon the food returns
from a given area of land as upon the
products from a given amount or unit of
labor.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>KINDS OF HORTICULTURE</p>
</div>

<p>In that form of intensive agriculture to
which is given the designation horticulture,
there may be recognized several more or
less distinct divisions, as fruit growing,
market gardening, truck farming and
floriculture. Each has its own special problems,
based upon conditions of culture and
market. While, as in all classifications,
there is more or less overlapping, the
tendency is for them to become more and
more distinct. The market gardener is the
producer of vegetables for a local market,
while the truck farmer produces similar
products for a larger or wider distribution.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
The former grows a great variety of
products, disposing of them in relatively
small quantity, not infrequently directly to
the consumer. The latter raises a few
highly specialized crops which he sells in
gross, usually through a commission merchant.
Truck farming has developed since
1860, in consequence of the growth of large
cities, which require enormous supplies of
vegetables of fairly uniform quality, and on
account of the continuous demand for fresh
vegetables as nearly as possible throughout
the year. Watermelons and sweet potatoes
can be raised in the southern states and laid
down in New York City or Boston more
cheaply than they can be raised in the
suburbs of these cities, and, what is equally
important, they will be of superior quality.</p>
<p>The extension of railway facilities, the introduction
of refrigerator cars and the
building of cold storage plants has made it
possible to grow in one climate products
to be consumed in another. Cold storage
has enabled the fruit growers of California
to supply the eastern markets with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
peaches and other fresh fruit. Chicago,
to give only one example, begins to receive
strawberries, cabbages and tomatoes from
the shores of the Gulf of Mexico early in
the year and continues to receive these
products, until finally they are being shipped
late in the summer from the shores of Lake
Superior. It is estimated that the change of
locality from which these products come,
travels northward at the rate of from 13 to
15 miles a day.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>IMPORTANT FACTORS IN INTENSIVE FARMING</p>
</div>

<p>In the neighborhood of large cities, notably
in the environs of Paris, market gardeners
often produce their vegetables in made
soil. The local character of the soil under
such conditions is a matter of comparative
indifference, since a board floor would
answer every requirement as a resting place
for the artificial soil. The large expense
in preparing and constantly renewing the
seed bed is only economically possible, however,
where proximity to a large city out-weighs
all other considerations.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>Ordinarily climatic and soil adaptation
are prime factors in successful horticulture&mdash;much
more than in any other branch of
agriculture. Each fruit has a restricted
climatic range, and in most cases the number
of soil types on which a given fruit can
be made a commercial success is likewise
limited. Thus, in general, apples and pears
require heavier soils than peaches. Success
in commercial apple growing requires even
greater discrimination, since different varieties
of apples demand different soil conditions.
Thus Baldwins are grown the most
successfully where a northern climate is
modified by proximity to the Great Lakes.
Rhode Island Greenings will succeed on
soils too heavy for many other varieties.
The York Imperial has not yet achieved a
great commercial success save on one type of
soil. Some varieties of apples are much
more restricted in their adaptation than
others. Thus, while the King is quite
restricted, the Ben Davis has a fairly wide
cultural adaptation. No one should plant
an orchard until he has made a thorough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
study of his soil and climatic conditions and
has received the highest possible expert
assistance in choosing the varieties best
adapted to his conditions.</p>
<p>There is an increasing tendency to
specialize in vegetable growing. The production
of celery, onions, muskmelons,
watermelons, cabbages, cauliflowers, tomatoes
and sweet corn, to mention only some of
the most striking examples, are becoming
more and more localized. Even where
vegetables and flowers are grown under
glass, not only is each house devoted to a
single species, but, notably in the case of
roses, growers are restricting themselves
more and more to a few varieties. This is
due to the fact that it is impossible to give
in one house, or even in one establishment,
the special set of conditions required for the
most economic development of each species
or variety of plant, just as in the open air
the natural conditions are best adapted to a
limited number of horticultural products.</p>
<p>So much being admitted, it follows that
it is folly to attempt to grow plants under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
unfavorable climatic and soil conditions
when competing in the same market with
those possessing favorable ones. It is true,
of course, that where one man fails another
often succeeds, but this is no reason why a
man should apply his talents under unfavorable
circumstances. In fact, one of the
important attributes of most successful men
is their ability to recognize and apply their
energies under conditions which will give
them the most effective return for a given
effort. There is no virtue in unnecessary
toil. Progress in any enterprise, as progress
in the human race, can be accomplished
only in reducing the amount of labor
required to produce a desired result.</p>
<p>All this is axiomatic. The purpose of
emphasizing it here is that it is fundamental
to the success of those who attempt to produce
horticultural products. The necessity
for the emphasis lies in the fact that these
factors are so often disregarded. They are
of most vital importance to the man who
attempts to raise tree fruits. A mistake in
the planting of celery, cabbage, or onions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
may be rectified the following season, but if
a mistake is made in planting tree fruits, it
may, as in the case of apples, require ten or
even 20 years to discover the error.</p>
<p>The growth in commercial orcharding is
due in part to the need of special knowledge
and facilities for combating fungous diseases
and insect enemies and to the better
markets which a large production of uniform
quality makes possible. While these
are extremely important considerations,
there is a more fundamental reason, which
may in the long run exercise an even more
potent influence. The location of the
ordinary family orchard, so called, has been
determined in almost every instance by the
location of the farm buildings. There is no
necessary relation between a good site for a
farm dwelling and a suitable location for
an orchard. It happens, therefore, that
family orchards, taken as a whole, are not
grown under as favorable conditions as
are commercial orchards. This is a sufficient
reason in itself, even if the other reasons
above mentioned did not exist, why the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
commercial orchard must, in time, supplant
these accidental plantings.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>ADVANTAGES OF HORTICULTURE</p>
</div>

<p>The advantages of this intensive form of
agriculture as compared with the more
extensive forms discussed in Chapter XII
may be stated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A large gross income per acre may
be obtained. An investigation of truck
farming made some years ago indicated a
gross return per acre about 40 times as great
as that obtained on an average from all
forms of agriculture.</p>
<p>(2) There is a large opportunity for the
use of skill in raising and preparing
products for market and an equal opportunity
for the exercise of judgment in choosing
the best markets.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>DISADVANTAGES OF HORTICULTURE</p>
</div>

<p>(1) It requires considerable capital, particularly
for machinery and labor. In the
investigation in truck farming above mentioned
the capital per acre invested in land,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
buildings, implements and teams was eight
times that in the more general forms of agriculture.</p>
<p>(2) The products are for the most part
readily perishable, requiring special facilities
if held for any length of time.</p>
<p>(3) Growing out of above-mentioned
fact, the market is easily overstocked at any
given point, and hence prices often fluctuate
widely.</p>
<p>(4) The yield is also quite variable, this
class of products being especially influenced
by seasonal conditions and particularly subject
to insect attacks and fungous diseases.
Since large capital is invested in labor, the
horticulturist may be involved in financial
ruin through causes which he is unable to
control.</p>
<p>(5) The labor question, in certain forms
of horticulture more than in others, involves
difficulties, among which is need of large
quantities of cheap labor for short periods
of time.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>REASONS FOR ANIMAL<br />HUSBANDRY</h3>
</div>

<p>Animal products in the United States
nearly equal in value those of all other
farm products. Those soil supplies which
constitute the food of domestic animals are
not implied. Practically every farm in the
United States keeps domestic animals,
either for their labor or their products, and
nearly every household in both city and
country keeps one or more animals for companionship.
The domestication of animals
has been a prime factor in the civilization
of the human race by furnishing man with
motive force by which he has been able to
increase his productive power; by giving
him a larger, better and more regular food
supply; and by furnishing the materials for
clothing, making it possible for him to inhabit
temperate and even arctic climates.
Animals have not been less important in
advancing the spiritual welfare of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
human race, by inculcating habits of regularity
and kindliness, which the care of
domestic animals imposes.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>INCREASE IN ANIMAL PRODUCTION</p>
</div>

<p>During the last half century animals have
not increased in numbers as rapidly as have
the inhabitants, but the value of animals has
increased much more rapidly. While a part
of this increase in value is due perhaps to a
greater cost of production, a couple of illustrations
will suffice to show that part of this
increase in value has been due to increase in
the individual merit of the animals. In
1850 sheep in this country produced 2.4
pounds of wool per fleece; in 1910 they produced
6.9 pounds per fleece. Thus, while in
50 years sheep have not quite doubled in
numbers, the production of wool has increased
more than five times. This is a
striking example of the value of improvement
in breeding, because the improvement
in wool production is due to the
influence of heredity in far greater degree
than to the effect of improved feeding.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
Wool, like the hair on ones head, is not
greatly influenced by the food supply,
assuming it to be reasonably ample. Beef
cattle offer another illustration of the way
in which animal products have been
increased without increasing the number of
animals. Formerly beef cattle were matured
in their fourth and fifth years, or even
their sixth year. They are now placed upon
the market in their second and third years.
If animals can be matured in their third
instead of their fifth year, it is obvious that
a much smaller number of animals must be
kept upon the farm in order to provide an
equal annual supply for slaughter.</p>
<p>The increase in the size of our horses and
the increased production of butter fat per
cow which have occurred in the past half
century are hardly less important factors in
increasing the value of domestic animals
and their products.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>THE FUTURE OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most striking features of recent
progress in domestic animals is the large
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
increase in the number of horses and the
still greater increase in their value. There
are those who have believed that the invention
of many beneficent forms of mechanical
power would in time, if not in the very near
future, supplant the use of animals as a
motive power. The fact seems to be, however,
that they merely augment mans
resources and increase his opportunities
without lessening his need for animal
power.</p>
<p>It appears reasonable to suppose that
there will be witnessed in the United States
a gradual shifting of live stock centers.
During the past half century, the great central
West has been noted for the production
of live stock, particularly for beef, mutton
and wool, as an incident of its pioneer development.
Already the production of
large herds of cattle and flocks of sheep has
disappeared for the central West, and is
now confined largely to Texas and the
mountain states. The northeastern states are
unrivaled in the production of grass, and
have considerable areas less fitted for tillage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
than the prairie states. In time, therefore,
the tendency will be for the regions best
fitted to rear animals to increase their numbers
of breeding animals. On the other
hand, those states which produce grain in
relatively large abundance may give more
attention to fattening animals and to the
production of dairy products which can be
shipped long distances. As time advances,
the history of other countries will doubtless
be repeated. A greater distinction between
the breeding and rearing of animals, and
their fattening and preparation for market
will occur.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>ADVANTAGES OF KEEPING LIVE STOCK</p>
</div>

<p>Since animals occupy a place in practically
all farm organizations, it is desirable
to state briefly the advantages and disadvantages
which may accrue to any individual
enterprise. The most striking
advantages affecting the farmer are:</p>
<p>(1) Animals make it possible to use land
that would otherwise be wholly or partly
unproductive. Hillsides and mountain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
slopes, soil too stony to cultivate, fields
traversed by winding streams, and land partially
covered with trees, are familiar examples.
As previously mentioned, only about
one-half the farm area in this country is
improved land, and only two-thirds, even of
the improved land, is in cultivated crops.
The other third of the improved land and
a considerable portion of that half of the
farm area known as unimproved land are
utilized as pasture for domestic animals.</p>
<p>(2) They make use of farm crops which
would be entirely or partially wasted.
Straw, the stalks of maize, clover and
alfalfa hay and other leguminous forage
crops would not have sufficient value to pay
for raising if animals were not kept to convert
them into useful products. In fact, the
usefulness of a given animal may be judged
by the economy with which he converts
these otherwise useless products into food or
other materials for the use of man. The
most profound studies are being made to
determine the conditions under which this
takes place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>(3) In thus acting as machines in manufacturing
raw materials into finished products
animals convert these coarse and
bulky materials into those which are much
more concentrated, thus making their transportation
economically possible. A pound
of beef has required food containing ten
pounds of dry substance, and a pound of butter
has required thirty pounds of dry matter
to produce it.</p>
<p>These refined products may be shipped
around the world, while the raw materials
may not be profitably transported beyond
the county in which they are raised. Moreover,
the farmer has the profit which comes
from manufacturing the raw materials into
refined products.</p>
<p>(4) In the production of these finer
products much of the essential materials of
plant growth are left upon the farm. The
experiments of Lawes and Gilbert show
conclusively that in fattening animals more
than nine pounds out of ten of the essential
fertilizing ingredients of the food reappear
in the solid and liquid excrements. Prothero
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
says: Farming in a circle, unlike logic,
is a productive process.</p>
<p>The fiscal policy of one of the great
nations of the globe is based upon this idea.
Everything possible is done by Germany to
encourage the keeping of live stock, because
the more live stock that is kept, the more
productive will be the soil. The larger the
crops raised the more people will be
required to harvest them and the larger will
be the population to recruit the army and
navy. The Kaiser and the German scientist
recognize that the fighting force of the
Empire is related to the number of domestic
animals reared. The meat supplies of the
people are, therefore, taxed to bring about
this end.</p>
<p>(5) The rearing of live stock makes it
possible to arrange a better rotation of crops.
A five-year and, even better, a six-year rotation,
is more effective than a four-year in
maintaining the crop-producing power of
the soil and enables the farmer to reduce his
cost of production. It is possible to keep a
larger proportion of the farm in grass and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
other forage crops, thus reducing the
amount of land plowed annually and at the
same time decreasing the exhaustion of the
land, provided the forage crops are fed to
live stock upon the farm.</p>
<p>There is an old Flemish proverb which
reads:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>No grass, no cattle;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 1em;'>No cattle, no manure;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 1em;'>No manure, no crops.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The point of this proverb is that good
grass is the basis of good agriculture. Investigations
have shown that one may go
farther and say that one of the most ready
means of increasing the crop-producing
power of the soil is by adding fertilizers to
grass land. The large number of plants per
acre enables the plants to utilize the fertilizer
to the highest degree, and plowing
under the resulting dense sod is one of the
most effective methods of enriching the soil.</p>
<p>(6) Animals require constant care, thus
making possible a more constant use of labor
and other capital. The wheat farmer of
North Dakota sows his wheat in April and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
May and harvests it in July and August.
He usually threshes it immediately, and is
practically without employment for himself,
his teams or his men from September
until April. On live stock farms the labor
employed in the summer in the field is
needed in the winter in paddocks and
stables.</p>
<p>(7) The management of live stock, including
the rearing of poultry and the
manipulation of dairy products, may be
made to require a higher skill than the production
of farm crops as ordinarily practiced.
The communities which have given
the most attention to dairying and to the
rearing and fattening of animals have generally
been the most prosperous.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>DISADVANTAGES OF KEEPING LIVE STOCK</p>
</div>

<p>(1) Keeping live stock increases the capital
required to operate a given area of land,
especially where animals are kept in connection
with the production of hay and
grain. Not only must there be capital with
which to purchase animals, but usually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
more is invested in buildings. In a self-contained
farm&mdash;that is, one which raises
sufficient food for the requirements of the
live stock&mdash;ten dollars an acre may be considered
a moderate investment for animals.
If, however, the plan is to raise only the
coarse feed, while the necessary grain as
well as other concentrates is largely purchased,
a farm may easily carry from $25
to $35 worth of live stock per acre. Lack
of capital is one of the most potent influences
in preventing a larger production of
animals and animal products. Cattle paper,
or notes given to secure money for the purchase
of fattening animals, is a common
bank asset in the feeding districts of the central
West.</p>
<p>(2) The very perishable nature of animals
entails a great risk in the investment
of capital in live stock. Not only the
products of a single year, but the growth of
a number of years, may be suddenly swept
away by disease. This may include the
crops of several years, thus destroying capital
invested in the production of the crops
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
as well as the capital originally invested in
the animals. Many a farmer has seen the
gradual accumulations of years rapidly melt
away in the presence of some contagious
disease. Tuberculosis in cattle, cholera in
hogs and liver rot in sheep are striking examples
of diseases that have caused the
farmers of this country untold losses.</p>
<p>(3) When an animal has been properly
fattened he must be sold. If held for any
great length of time, not only is there a constant
outlay for food to maintain the animal,
but the condition of the animal may actually
deteriorate. Hence it is not possible to hold
animals for a better market for a long
period of time, as is possible in the case of
the cereal grains.</p>
<p>(4) Serious losses may occur where profit
was expected through a rise in the price of
foodstuffs. Scarcity in food supplies, due
to an unfavorable season, often compels the
stockman to sacrifice animals that he has
been raising for two or three years. It is
sometimes asserted that, although society
suffers from short crops, the farmer is benefited,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
because the increase in price is greater
than the decrease in yield. One year, for
example, the decrease in the production of
maize was 30%, while the increase in price
was 50%. If, therefore, the crop had been
sold it would have brought more than the
crop of the previous year. The farmers,
however, require about 80% of the maize
crop in the production of their live stock,
so that when there was a decrease of 30% in
the yield of maize, many had none to sell,
while others had to purchase maize at
increased prices or use other crops, such as
oats, which they might otherwise have sold.
Still others would be compelled to sell, at
reduced prices, their partially fattened
animals. There is a constant fluctuation in
the price of animals and animal products,
due to variation in yield and hence in price
of food supplies. It requires continual
vigilance on the part of the stockman to
secure food supplies at such cost as will
enable him to secure a profitable return
from his animals.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>RETURNS FROM ANIMALS</h3>
</div>

<p>In any well-considered plan of farm operations
it is essential to have some basis
for estimating the amount of food required
to carry live stock through the year in order
to know, on the one hand, what portion of
the crops raised are available for sale and,
on the other hand, what food supplies must
be purchased. A requisite of any successful
farm enterprise is a proper consideration of
these market conditions. While domestic
animals consume a variety of foods, and
each class of animals has special food
requirements, the basis of calculation of the
needed supplies is fortunately not complicated.
Twenty-five pounds of dry matter
are required per day for each thousand
pounds of live weight of horses, cattle and
sheep, and for swine about 40 pounds for
each thousand pounds of live weight. It
may be more convenient to calculate the
food requirement of swine on the basis of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
increase in live weight, allowing five pounds
of dry matter for each pound of increase.
Some further details as to food requirements
will be found in the paragraphs which
follow.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>COST OF PRODUCING HOGS</p>
</div>

<p>Pigs possess two characteristics which
make them unique among domestic animals.
They consume concentrated and easily
digested foods only, and they produce nothing
but meat, fat and bristles. Cattle furnish
milk and hides; sheep, wool, hides and
sometimes milk; fowls furnish eggs and
feathers. On account of their limited range
of usefulness and because of the high value
of much of the food consumed, it would not
be possible to rear swine economically were
it not for their prolificacy and the fact that
they are employed largely as scavengers.
Many cattle are fattened without direct
profit. The indirect profit comes from the
sale of the pigs which have followed the cattle.
It is customary to mature one hog with
little or no additional food while fattening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
two steers. In many well-known ways, pigs
consume products which would otherwise
be wasted. This is especially true in the
more densely settled sections of the world.</p>
<p>On account of their prolificacy, the
returns obtained for the amount of capital
invested is greater than in the case
of sheep, cattle or horses. Ten sows,
worth $100 to $150, are sufficient to
produce 100 pigs; 75 to 80 ewes, worth
from $300 to $500, are required to produce
an equal number of lambs; 110 cows, worth
$4,500 to $6,000, to produce 100 calves; and
200 mares, worth from $20,000 to $30,000,
to guarantee 100 foals. To put the matter
in another way, the capital invested in
swine may be reproduced in the offspring
ten times in one year; the capital invested
in horses not more than once in five years.</p>
<p>In general, 500 pounds of maize will produce
100 pounds of pork, which is equivalent
to eleven pounds of pork from a bushel.
Since hogs are so largely produced from
maize, the price of maize and the price of
pork are very closely related. For example,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
if maize is worth fifty cents a bushel, the
grain required to produce a pound of
increase in live weight will cost about 5
cents; if 40 cents a bushel, 4 cents; if 30 cents
a bushel, 3 cents; and so on.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>COST OF PRODUCING SHEEP</p>
</div>

<p>In the classic investigations by Lawes and
Gilbert, food containing 100 pounds of dry
matter produced a live-weight increase of
nine pounds in steers and 11 pounds in
sheep. At the Wisconsin station, sheep
required less food than steers per pound of
gain. During rapid fattening of sheep 500
pounds of clover hay and 400 pounds of
maize may produce 100 pounds of increase
in live weight. While swine require a less
weight of food for a pound of increase than
sheep, on account of the more digestible
character of the food eaten, yet the Wisconsin
station found that the expense of producing
a pound of increase was less in sheep on
account of the less expensive character of
the food.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>MEAT AND MILK PRODUCTION COMPARED</p>
</div>

<p>A summary of the investigations of
American experiment stations shows that
100 pounds of dry matter produced ten
pounds of increase in live weight of steers.
The same quantity of food when fed to
milch cows produced 74 pounds of milk,
plus one pound of increase in live weight.
This 74 pounds of milk contained 3-1/4
pounds of fat. In general, therefore, the
food required to produce a pound of butter
fat is about three times that required to
produce a pound of increase in steers.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>COST OF STEER FEEDING</p>
</div>

<p>The fattening of beef animals is largely
conducted by farmers who make a specialty
of it. This is particularly true in the so-called
corn belt. Into this region are gathered
the two and three-year-old and, more
rarely, yearling steers, many of which have
been reared in Texas or in the mountain
states where the supply of maize is not sufficiently
ample to fatten them. These are
placed in paddocks with open sheds, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
they are fed from 90 to 150 days, after which
they are sent to market for slaughter. The
food consists usually of maize fodder, maize
stover, hay, maize (usually in the ear), a
little bran, linseed or cottonseed oil meal.
The ration per day during rapid fattening is
about 20 pounds of dry matter per 1,000
pounds of live weight, containing 16 pounds
of digestible substance, of which 1.25 to 1.75
is digestible protein. One hundred pounds
of increase may be obtained under average
conditions from 150 pounds stover, 325
pounds of hay, 775 pounds of maize and 75
pounds of cottonseed meal.</p>
<p>Great variations will occur, however,
depending upon the condition of the animals
at the beginning of the feeding period
and the degree of fatness or finish to which
the animals are brought before placing upon
the market. In any case, the food consumed
will cost more than the value of the increase.
The only way that steers can be profitably
fattened is by increasing the value per
pound of the animal. Thus an 800-pound
steer may be purchased at five cents per
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
pound, or $40. After feeding, say 150 days,
he may weigh 1,100 pounds, when to bring
a profitable return he should sell for 6 cents
a pound, or $65. This is a gain of $25, eight
of which came from the increase in value of
the original 800 pounds. Usually steers
cannot be fattened profitably unless there is
an increase of at least three-quarters of a
cent per pound in the value of the animals
and then, as previously explained, only in
connection with the hogs which follow
them.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>COST OF PRODUCING MILK AND BUTTER FAT</p>
</div>

<p>Well-selected and properly fed cows may
produce 240 pounds of butter fat annually.
The amount of fat obtained will depend
upon the richness of the milk. Thus, 8,000
pounds of 3% milk, 6,000 pounds of 4%
milk, or a trifle less than 5,000 pounds of
5% milk, will give this quantity of butter
fat. These are customary returns from different
types of cows.</p>
<p>If each cow in the herd is dry for six
weeks each year the daily average of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
cows actually milked will be three-quarters
of a pound of butter fat. There are herds
which make an average of nine-tenths of a
pound of butter fat per day, but to secure
this result requires superior cattle, careful
feeding and more than ordinary care.</p>
<p>The standard ration for milch cows
weighing from 1,000 to 1,200 pounds is 25
pounds of dry matter, two-thirds of which
is digestible. The ration should contain not
less than two pounds of digestible protein. In
ordinary practice, about ten pounds of the
dry matter of the ration is obtained from
maize silage, nine pounds from hay and
about six pounds from grain or other concentrates.
In general, this is obtained by
feeding 35 pounds of maize silage, ten
pounds of hay and seven to eight pounds of
concentrates. The silage may be estimated
at one-tenth to one-eighth of a cent a pound,
hay at from one-fourth to one-half cent and
concentrates at from three-quarters to one
and one-quarter cents per pound, varying,
of course, with the different sections of the
country. The amount of food needed will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
vary somewhat with the size of the animals,
but will depend much more largely upon
the amount of milk and butter fat given.
While maintaining substantially the general
average just given for the whole herd, it is
the practice of careful feeders to vary the
amount of concentrates fed to each individual
in accordance with the amount of butter
fat or milk given.</p>

<div class='ce'>
<p>COST OF MAINTAINING WORK HORSES</p>
</div>

<p>At the Minnesota station, the total cost of
feeding and maintaining a farm work horse
for one year was estimated to be from $75
to $90, of which about $20 was charged for
interest and depreciation. On the basis of
3.3 hours as the length of the working day,
the cost per horse per hour was estimated to
be 7-1/2 cents. At the Ohio state university, it
was found that four horses weighing about
1,400 pounds were chosen to perform 2,185
hours of labor during one year, while under
like conditions four horses, weighing about
200 pounds less, worked on an average but
1,641 hours each. For each secular day,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
therefore, the former worked about 7-1/2
hours, while the latter were employed but
five and one-half hours. The cost of food
was estimated at $54; cost of shoeing,
repairs of harness and stable supplies at
$6.50; and the cost of feeding, grooming
and cleaning of stables at $23.50, or a total
cost of $84 per year. Nothing was charged
for interest or depreciation, but the expense
of feeding and caring for three colts was
included in the estimates given. The annual
expense of maintaining a horse was
practically the same in both states, but the
cost per hour of labor performed was less
because of the possibility of employing the
horses at productive labor a larger portion
of the time. Too much emphasis cannot be
placed upon the need of planning a farm
organization which will give continuous
employment to horses as well as to men in
order to realize the most profitable returns.
An industrial system that makes it necessary
to maintain work animals three days in
order to secure one days work falls far
short of an ideal.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>FARM LABOR</h3>
</div>

<p>The problem of farm labor demands
thoughtful and frank consideration.
Since work is an essential element in the production
of all wealth, it follows that every
industry has its labor problem. The adjustment
of labor to the production of the
various forms of wealth must ever constitute
one of the most important problems in any
organized society. It is often remarked
that the labor problem is the chief difficulty
in farming. In a certain sense this is true,
since work is a primary element in the production
of agricultural as well as all other
wealth. It is not true, however, that the
problem of labor is more difficult or more
intricate than that of other industries. In
fact, that problem is less delicate than in
some other occupations, because farming is
less industrialized.</p>
<p>It is not possible to settle once for all the
problem of labor for any occupation, since
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
changing conditions will give rise to new
questions or new phases of the old problem.
Moreover, the problem of labor on the farm
will grow more difficult as farming becomes
more specialized and as the methods of production
become more complex.</p>
<p>However, the labor problem on the farm
is different from that in the manufacturing
industries or in trade and transportation.
This chapter will not concern itself with
an attempt to settle the farm labor problem,
but will undertake to state the character of
some of the differences between it and other
forms of labor and to discuss some of the
changes in recent years.</p>
<p>A large proportion of farm work is done
by the farm owner, or renter, and his family.
There is not much opportunity to profit by
the labor of other persons. In 1900 there
were in the United States 1,812 industrial
establishments each of which employed
between 500 and 1,000 persons, while there
were 675 establishments each of which had
more than one thousand employees. In the
same year there were 5,739,657 farms, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
employed in the aggregate 4.4 millions of
people, not including the owners of the
farms. Moreover, over one-half of the 4.4
million persons thus employed were members
of the families of the farmer. In other
words, aside from members of the family,
there was less than one employee to every
two farmers. Since a considerable number
of farmers employ more than one person,
it follows that the majority of farmers employ
no help other than members of the
family.</p>
<p>In another particular farm labor differs
from that of other forms of labor even more
widely. There are sociologic as well as
economic questions involved. Baldly stated,
custom permits, and necessity often requires,
the laborer to eat at the same table with the
farm owner and in other particulars he
mingles intimately with the farmers family.
In all its bearings, this is a very important
fact. It constitutes one of the greatest difficulties
in the problem of securing suitable
farm help. Industrial corporations employ
as common laborers largely Italians, Hungarians,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
Poles and negroes. The English,
the Irish, the German, the Swede and the
Norwegian have been readily received and
assimilated in the American farming communities.
The peoples of Eastern and
Southern Europe are often criticized because
they do not become farm laborers.
That they do not is in large part due to the
fact that the farm hand is usually a member
of the farmers family. Thus the supply of
common labor which is today used by the
rest of the industrial world is not open to the
farmer.</p>
<p>Farming differs from some other occupations
in that it does not ordinarily offer
the laborer much opportunity for advancement.
The fireman on a railway train becomes
the engineer; the brakeman becomes
a conductor. There are opportunities in
many establishments for the advancement of
the industrious and clever. A man may
enter their service with the hope of being
able to marry and support a family. On
the other hand, all our land laws are based
upon the idea that each farm should be of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
sufficient size to support only one family.
Where it does support two families, the
relation is usually that of landlord and tenant.
The farm laborer, therefore, must
look upon his employment as more or less
temporary. The young man who intends
to become a farmer will find employment
upon the farm a desirable if not essential
preparation for his future occupation.</p>
<p>The introduction of farm machinery has
had the effect of increasing the price of
farm labor while at the same time decreasing
the amount of labor needed. The reason
is that the introduction, not alone of
farm machinery, but all forms of machinery,
has made mans labor much more efficient
than formerly. Farm wages have doubled
since the introduction of horse-drawn
machinery. The labor income in the different
sections of the United States is influenced
by the extent and efficiency with
which machinery is used. The relation of
labor income to the use of horse power is
shown by the following table taken from a
recent census:

<p>In one of the states of the South Atlantic
division the average price of farm labor,
without board, was $12 per month, while in
one of the states of the western division the
price on the same date was $31. Why?
Because in the latter case a mans labor was
more productive. In the South Atlantic
division, in producing the chief crops cotton
and maize, a man uses one mule in preparing
and cultivating the soil. In the western
division plowing and harrowing with six-horse
teams is common and nine-horse teams
are not unusual. The cotton picker in one
day will be able to gather not to exceed 300
pounds of seed cotton, worth not more than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
$15. The western wheat will be harvested
by a machine drawn by 28 horses. In the
same time four men with this outfit will cut
and thresh 700 bushels of wheat, worth $500.</p>
<p>When the threshing machine was first
introduced in Ohio, it was stubbornly
opposed by all farm laborers. They
claimed it, says Bateman, as a right to
thresh with a flail, and regarded the introduction
of machinery to effect the same
object in a few days which would require
their individual exertion during the whole
winter, not only as an invasion of a time-honored
custom, but as absolutely depriving
them of the means of obtaining an honest
livelihood. At a later date, when a reaper
had been introduced into a field of ripe
wheat as a matter of experiment only, every
one of the harvest hands deliberately
marched out of the field and told the proprietor
that he might secure his crop as best
he could, that the threshing machine had
deprived them of their regular winter work
twenty years ago and now the reaper would
deprive them of the pittance they otherwise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
could earn during harvest. How short-sighted
they were! No class gained so much
from the introduction of labor-saving
machinery as did those who did the labor.
The reason for the increase in well-being,
the reason society enjoys luxuries and comforts
beyond the fondest dreams of former
generations, is due to the fact that the labor
of each man has been made so much more
effective through these labor-saving devices.
The humblest citizen shares in this improvement.
Not all share alike and not all share
equitably, but each generation sees its members
sharing more equitably than those of
any generation which preceded it.</p>
<p>The proposition is an extremely simple
one. If a man produces just enough food
for himself and family, he will have nothing
for clothing, shelter, or education. If,
however, a man produces four times as
much food as he and his family consume, he
may exchange one-fourth for shelter, one-fourth
for clothing and have remaining a
fourth for education, and recreation or savings.
This is only another way of saying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
that the greater the amount of any useful
commodity produced by a single days labor
the larger will be the laborers income or
wages.</p>
<p>Although the increase in intensive agriculture
and the diversification in farming
tend to increase the need of farm laborers,
the introduction of farm machinery has
much more than offset this demand. The
tendency of farm laborers to become farm
tenants; or, to state it in other words, the
tendency of landowners to rent their land
rather than to continue to operate it themselves,
is not without its influence upon the
labor problem.</p>
<p>The invention and introduction of farm
machinery has accentuated the difficulty of
keeping the farm laborer continuously employed.
The decrease in the demand for
farm labor and the increasing lack of uniformity
in the amount required have caused
a gradual depletion of the smaller villages
and hamlets which were a source of labor
supply during harvest and other busy seasons.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>The problem of keeping labor continuously
employed has always been a difficult
one on the farm, because of the change of
seasons and because of the variations in the
weather from day to day. There is a wide
difference between those industries which
are carried on within doors and farming,
which is subject to the caprices of the
weather. Natural causes produce tremendous
variations in the return for labor. For
example, in 1901 there were produced in
the aggregate 3,006 million bushels of
wheat, maize and oats, while in 1902 there
were harvested 4,180 million bushels. Here
is an increase of over a thousand million
bushels. The same farmers tilled the same
soil in the same way as far as natural causes
would allow, and yet there was a difference
in result amounting to 39 per cent. A variation
of one hundred million bushels of
wheat from year to year, due to climatic
conditions solely, is not at all unusual.</p>
<p>The manufacturer also has far greater
control of his labor. When it rains, he has
a roof over his workmen, and hence the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
work is not interrupted. When it grows
dark, he turns on the light and the work
continues. If it gets cold, he lights the fire
and still the work continues comfortably.
It is not so in agriculture. There is a great
variation in the working efficiency of men
employed in farming. In a certain locality
there were twenty-one days of rain in the
thirty-one days of May. The next year
between June 5 and September 5 in the same
locality there was not half an inch of
rainfall at any one time.</p>
<p>What is true of labor is also true of
machinery. The farmer must purchase
machinery which he can use only a few days
in the year, while the manufacturer, for the
most part, employs his machinery continuously,
sometimes day and night. While
natural causes prevent the farmer from
using the same business methods, or from
being able to calculate his profits with the
same precision as is possible by those following
manufacturing and mercantile pursuits,
it is nevertheless important that
farming should be planned to avoid, as far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
as possible, the influence of natural causes.
Certain kinds of farming are less dependent
upon natural causes than others. Wisdom
and foresight can do much to avoid, in all
farming, untoward influences. The clever
farmer seldom complains about the weather.</p>
<p>Farm machinery has made unnecessary,
and hence unprofitable, some of the labor at
which children were formerly employed.
In the not distant past many, perhaps most
farmers, owed their prosperity in large
measure to the labor of their children. A
large family, especially of boys, was a valuable
asset. Even a generation ago conditions
were not far different, and two generations
ago were quite the same as those described
by Homer:</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>The reapers due repast, the womens care.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>There is also another reason why the age
of the employed has been raised. It is
due to the growth of higher education.
Where formerly the farmers children between
the ages of twelve and twenty-one did
most of the farm work, now many of them
at the same age are attending schools and
colleges. The sons of a man, who a generation
ago found no opportunity to get beyond
the district school, graduate from high
school and college, and thus spend most of
their time in study until they are past
twenty-one years of age.</p>
<p>Labor unions have doubtless caused a
scarcity of farm labor by increasing the proportion
of the created wealth which goes
to the man who labors without capital.
When a man can obtain fifty cents an hour
for laying brick, he does not wish to work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
in the hay field at twenty cents an hour, even
though the difference in the cost of living
may in great measure offset the difference in
wages.</p>
<p>There is a growing tendency to perform
work by what is called contract labor. Thus
a person may agree to weed and hoe sugar
beets at a certain rate per acre. He, in turn,
employs a force of cheap laborers which he
sends from farm to farm to do this work.
The harvesting of fruits and garden crops is
not infrequently done in some such manner.
In one instance a contractor of laborers of
foreign birth has been furnishing them for
all kinds of farm work. He keeps 20 to 40
of these laborers on a small farm, furnishing
them a dwelling and selling them food
supplies. Farmers telephone for help when
in need. The contractor receives $1.65 for
a days work and pays the laborer $1.50.</p>
<p>It appears from the preceding considerations
that there are open to every farmer at
least three methods of increasing the efficiency
of farm labor. He may make every
days labor more efficient by use of labor-saving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
machinery and the employment of
it in the most efficient manner; as, for example,
using three 1,500-pound horses to his
farm machinery instead of a pair of 1,200-pound
horses. He may modify the character
of his farming in order that profitable
labor will be more continuous. He may
modify the method of employing labor; as,
for example, by introducing the system of
contracting labor for specific purposes
where feasible.</p>
<p>Increase in the price of farm labor is not
an evil. It is an indication that labor applied
to agriculture is becoming more productive
and hence more profitable. Since
more than one-half the labor of the farm is
done by the owner and his family, the
farmer is benefited through the rise in price
of farm wages. The more that labor can
be made to earn upon the farm, the better it
will be not only for the farm owner but for
society in general.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>SHIPPING</h3>
</div>

<p>The means of facile transportation and
the machinery of trade are the need and
the development of a complex civilization.
The importance of these useful adjuncts of
everyday life is indicated by the fact that
about one-fourth of all the people engaged
in gainful occupations in civilized communities
are employed in them. Nevertheless
the expense of transportation and trade
constitutes a tax upon the consumer which
it is the aim of modern methods to reduce to
the lowest limits. Recent investigations
indicate that for every thirteen dollars the
consumer expends for farm products the
producers receive six dollars. In some
directions most remarkable results have
been accomplished. A recent quotation on
wheat per bushel was as follows: Chicago,
$0.93; Antwerp, $1.04; London, $1.06;
Hamburg, $1.07. Eleven to 14 cents per
bushel represents the cost of haul and commissions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
between Chicago and the European
cities named. Methods of handling
have been so perfected that from the time
the western farmer places the bundle of
wheat at the mouth of the threshing
machine the grain literally flows through
the channels of trade until it reaches the
flour sack. On an average the English
miller pays about 20 cents a bushel more for
wheat than the American farmer receives
for it.</p>
<p>The cost of distributing many other farm
products is greater, although the range of
distribution is much less. The cost of haulage
and selling potatoes is from 25 to 50%
of the retail price, while with hay it is still
higher. The cost of distributing all forms
of truck and market garden produce is high
and often wasteful. Many attempts have
been made to eliminate a part of this cost
as well as to better the conditions of the
supplies when they reach the consumer.
While many individuals have been quite
successful in dealing directly with the consumer,
little has thus far been accomplished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
that affects general trade conditions. Great
improvements have been made in methods
of transportation and methods of preservation.
Cold storage and canned goods have
been the direction in which progress has
been notable.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>WASTEFUL METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION</p>
</div>

<p>Owing to customs and traditions there is
frequently a great waste of effort in some of
the methods of trade. The meat trade of
France is an excellent illustration. Certain
sections of France make a specialty of rearing
cattle. At a suitable age these animals
are purchased by other farmers who fatten
them. Many of the small towns maintain
market places at which fairs are held to
facilitate these negotiations. Frequently
there is a shipment from one region to another,
which is conducted by a middleman.
When fattened the steers are collected by a
stock buyer, who may ship them to La Villette,
the live stock market of Paris. Here
they are placed on sale through commission
men. There are the usual charges for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
yardage and food. After being sold the
animals are driven to the slaughterhouses.
The carcasses are then taken by wagon to
the great market of Paris located near the
center of the city. Here the retail vender of
meats comes, makes his purchase, reloads
the meat, which may have been unloaded
less than an hour before, carries it to his
shop, where the consumer seeks it. The
number of people concerned and the amount
of hand labor have been excessive.</p>
<p>Nor is the American system without its
faults. The Iowa or Illinois farmer fattens
cattle that may have been reared in Montana
or Texas. After the stock buyer, the
commission man and the stock yard company
have each taken his toll, the packer
ships the carcasses back to the very region
where the animals were fattened, when the
stockman may purchase it of the local
vender of meats. The facilities and perfection
with which these many transactions are
accomplished is one of the wonderful sights
of our country. Nevertheless the producer
of meat products may well consider whether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
some more economical system of distribution
may not be devised.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>SHIPMENTS: SOURCES OF INFORMATION</p>
</div>

<p>All railroad rates are now carefully
supervised by the federal government and
are open to the inspection of the public.
Such information as is ordinarily needed
may be obtained from the local station
agent, who is always glad to be of service to
patrons of his road. If information of a
special character is required, it may be
obtained by addressing the division freight
agent of the railroad in the region under
consideration. The name of this officer is
to be found in the circulars and upon the
posters of the railroad.</p>
<p>In addition to the freight facilities
offered by any individual railroad, there are
what are known as fast freight lines. These
agencies enable through and prompt shipment
from inland points in our own country
to inland points in another. An individual
railroad may operate in connection with
several such agencies. A certain railroad,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
for example, is combined with nine fast
freight lines. Freight agents of local roads
in the principal towns usually represent the
fast freight lines and are prepared to transact
business.</p>
<p>In seaport cities there are firms styling
themselves foreign freight contractors, outward
freight agents, steamship agents, or
ship brokers. These firms are prepared to
quote prices on shipments to any part of the
world on either regular or tramp ships.
They will give freely to intending shippers
full information concerning methods and
conditions of shipment. There is nothing
mysterious about the business of shipping
farm products. The necessary details may
be acquired by inquiry in the channels indicated
and by a little study of the data, which
will be cheerfully furnished.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>RAILROAD RATES</p>
</div>

<p>A great many factors are involved in
determining the rate which is charged for
transporting different products. In a certain
sense it is doubtless true that the rate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
charged is based upon what the traffic will
bear. The purpose here, however, is to state
some of the customs which exist rather than
to discuss the philosophy or justice of them.</p>
<p>The rate may vary with the value of the
product, without any regard to the cost of
the haul. Suppose the cost of shipping a
ten-gallon can of fresh milk between two
points to be 32 cents, the cost of shipping a
similar can of cream may be 50 cents. The
cost of shipping a carload of hay is less than
a carload of wheat.</p>
<p>In some instances, zones or belts have
been recognized, the rate from all towns
within each zone being the same for a given
product. Certain railroads centering in
New York recognize four zones for the
shipment of milk and cream, as follows:</p>
<table summary=''>

<tr>
<td>
Zone A--First 40 miles.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Zone B--Between 40 and 100 miles.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Zone C--Between 100 and 190 miles.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Zone D--Beyond 190 miles.
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>It will be noticed that the size of these
zones varies and may be the subject of adjustment
between railroads and shippers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>While less understood by the public, railroads
recognize zones or, more properly,
groups of towns in making rates to them
instead of from them, as in the instance
above mentioned. It is possible to change
the rate on a product to a given town by
classifying it in another group. The rate
on bran and other stock foods from central
western points to certain towns in New York
state has been the same as that charged to
Boston, Mass., while other towns in New
York not far removed have taken a lower
rate.</p>
<p>Differential rates are recognized to be
legitimate. Railroads are allowed to
charge a less rate for wheat intended for
export than that intended for local consumption.
There has sometimes been a wide difference
between the freight rate on wheat
between Kansas City and Galveston, Texas,
depending upon whether the wheat was to
be exported or intended for domestic use.</p>
<p>In certain sections and for certain products
the railroad rate varies with the season,
because of difference in competition. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
railroad rate between Chicago and New
York on grain is higher while the navigation
of the Great Lakes is suspended. As an
illustration of the cheapness of transportation
by water, it is stated that sometimes it
is cheaper to ship wheat from Chicago to
Buffalo by boat than to store it in a grain
elevator for an equal period of time.</p>
<p>Products may sometimes be sent by baggage
to greater advantage than by express,
special arrangements for which are generally
required.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>FACILITIES FOR FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION</p>
</div>

<p>American railway facilities are, perhaps,
unrivaled among the nations of the world,
but the United States is still behind other
nations in the matter of means of local
transportation, in which good roads is only
a part of the problem. In France, the so-called
<i>messagers</i> are a common feature of
local traffic. Thus in the Department of
Touraine there are 246 towns each having
from one to four <i>messagers</i>, who with their
great two-wheel carts, each with single draft
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
horse, make one or two trips to Tours each
week. The <i>messagers</i> carry freight both
ways precisely in the same capacity as railroads
do. While the railroads are fairly
abundant these local agencies continue to
thrive because delivery can be made directly
to the consignee and delivery at the exact
time and place is more certain. The
enormous loads conveyed in these two-wheel
carts by one horse is an element in this system
to which the good roads of France now
contribute. In 1799, France had constructed
25,000 miles of roadway. Since
that time, over 300,000 miles of roadway
have been completed and about 30,000
miles of railway have been constructed&mdash;ten
miles of roadway for each mile of
steam railway. The good roads of France
are of comparatively recent origin, contributing
materially to the improvement in
well-being which has taken place during the
same period.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>MARKETING</h3>
</div>

<p>Without stopping to inquire the
reasons, it may be recalled that there
are two rather distinct forms of trade,
wholesale and retail. The wholesale
trade is conducted by three classes
of persons: dealers or merchants, commission
men, and brokers. The dealer
is one who buys the goods outright and takes
his own risk on making a favorable sale to
the retailer. The commission man is one
who receives the goods, sells them at such
price as he may be able to obtain and remits
to the seller the amount obtained less expenses
and his commission. The broker is
a man who effects a sale without coming in
contact in any way with the materials sold.
A cheese broker, for example, receives instruction
from different factories to sell for
them a certain quantity of cheese of a given
kind and quality each week or month as the
case may be. At the same time he receives
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
from grocery stores which retail cheese
orders for various amounts, kinds and quality
of cheeses. With this information at
hand, he directs the various factories intrusting
their business to him to ship the kind,
quantity, and quality of cheese required by
his several customers. For such service he
receives a brokerage, which is less than that
charged by a commission man because he is
not required to handle or store the material.</p>
<p>Since the different farm products are purchased
by different classes of retailers, and
since their handling and sale require different
facilities and special knowledge, there
have arisen in the great centers of trade
different kinds of markets, each having its
particular facilities for the handling, care
and sale, and each conducted by commission
men or brokers with a special knowledge
of the trade. Furthermore, certain cities
have become, on account of their favorable
position&mdash;to mention but one reason&mdash;headquarters
for certain products or groups of
products. Thus Petersburg, Virginia, has
the principal wholesale market for peanuts.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
Elgin, Illinois, has been noted for its butter
market. St. Louis is the leading mart for
mules.</p>
<p>In a general way, the following five more
or less distinct and important classes of
markets for farm products may be recognized:
Grain, Live Stock, Produce, Cotton
and Tobacco.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>METHODS OF TRADE</p>
</div>

<p>The brokers or commission men doing
business in any one of these markets usually
form an association called a board of trade,
chamber of commerce or similar title for
the purpose of assisting each other in the
pursuit of common ends. The result has
been uniformity of methods and charges;
but above all in importance, perhaps, has
been the definition of classes and grades of
the products placed on sale. The tendency
is for the associations in the different cities
to adopt uniform rules for the grading of
products, so that No. 2 red winter wheat
may mean the same thing in Toledo and
New York; that the quotation on prime
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
beef may refer to the same quality of cattle
in Pittsburgh as it does in Chicago; and that
No. 1 Timothy hay in Baltimore and St.
Louis may be alike. While the tendency is
towards uniformity, much yet remains to be
accomplished. The shipper must be on his
guard lest he suffer loss through the variations
in the classification or variations in
their interpretations on the different
markets.</p>
<p>There has grown up around these markets
some agency which stands as a disinterested
party between seller and buyer impartially
determining the weight and in some cases
the quality of the object under negotiation.
The State of Illinois employs agents who inspect
all cars of grain consigned to the
Chicago market. These inspectors determine
the kind, grade and weight of the
grain in each car. The car is then delivered
under seal to the purchaser. If either seller
or buyer is dissatisfied with the inspectors
decision he may, by complying with certain
regulations, have this decision reviewed by
a higher authority. The decision of this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
higher authority is final and must be
accepted by both parties. Brokers selling
grain in carload lots ship the cars subject to
the weight and grade as determined by the
inspector at Chicago. Grain of a specific
grade may thus be bought in Chicago or
other great grain markets with almost perfect
security as to weight and quality by
persons living in any part of this or any
other country. At Elgin the quality of butter
is determined by a committee appointed
by the Board of Trade from its own members.
In the live stock markets, the stock
yards company, in addition to furnishing
yards, shelter, food and water, acts as agent
between seller and buyer in determining the
weight of the animals. The purchaser or
his agent must determine for himself the
quality of the animals he buys.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>GRAIN MARKETS</p>
</div>

<p>The Chicago and St. Paul Boards of
Trade and the New York Produce Exchange
are the three great agencies for
dealing in grain in the United States.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
Buffalo, Duluth, Baltimore and Philadelphia
are also important markets. Adjuncts
to these markets are the great terminal elevators
capable of holding almost indefinitely
enormous quantities of wheat and
other grain. On the Pacific Coast all the
wheat is handled in the bags, as is the custom
in the other markets of the world.
Canada and the United States alone have
recognized the principle that wheat and
other grains will run like water, which has
been a prime factor in their competition
with other nations.</p>
<p>Country elevators charge two cents a
bushel for storage during the first 15 days
and 1/2 cent for each additional 15 days. The
charge for storage at terminal elevators for
the first 15 days is 3/4 cent. The farmer
may thus store his wheat in an elevator in
place of his farm if he chooses so to do,
although the wheat he thus puts in storage
may have been made into flour and consumed
before he sells it. This may be
looked upon as a sort of intermediary step
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
between storing wheat in ones own granary
and dealing in futures.</p>
<p>The country shipper pays 1/2 cent a bushel
commission for the sale of wheat. There is
also a charge for inspection and insurance,
and, in case there is an advance payment,
for interest. After five days there are storage
charges. This has given rise to the expression,
gilt edge, regular and short receipts,
depending upon the length of time
there remains before storage charges must
be paid. Every market has a grade known
as contract grade, meaning the quality that
must be furnished when wheat or other
grain is sold without specifying the grade.
In Chicago No. 2 red winter wheat is the
contract grade. Where grain is sold or purchased
by a broker, the brokerage is usually
1/8 cent per bushel.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>HAY MARKETS</p>
</div>

<p>At least twenty cities have adopted the
rules of the National hay association as to
classes and grades of hay and straw. The
southern states constitute an important market
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
for the hay of the north central states,
while Boston, New York and the mining
towns of Pennsylvania are important markets
for the northeastern states. The size
of bale varies from 75 to 200 pounds. Small
bales of 100 pounds each are preferred in
Baltimore, medium bales of 110 to 140
pounds in Philadelphia, while New York
and Boston usually deal in the larger bales.
The commission charges vary from 50 cents
to $1 per car. In New York, $1 pays all
charges. At Chicago, $3 per car has been
charged for the inspection, divided equally
between seller and buyer.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>PRODUCE MARKETS</p>
</div>

<p>Every town of any consequence has its
produce market. The South Water street
district in Chicago and the West Washington
street market in New York are noted for
their extent and variety. There are also
many special markets for certain classes of
produce. Thus Elgin, Chicago and New
York have butter exchanges. Wisconsin,
Utica, Watertown and Cuba (New York)
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
maintain exchanges where cheese is placed
on sale each week during the manufacturing
season. There is also a board of trade for
cheese in New York City. The prices
quoted upon these exchanges are made the
basis of many transactions between buyer
and seller, who never enter these markets.
Not only do buyers and sellers agree to
abide by the quotations of one or the other of
these markets, but the quotations are also
used as a basis of settlement for milk furnished
the creamery or factory. These
agencies are thus impartial arbiters in countless
financial transactions.</p>
<p>The rate of commission varies in different
markets and for different products.
Generally, however, produce is handled on
a 5% basis, but for individual products
which are especially bulky and difficult to
handle, such as cabbage, 10% may be
charged. In some cases commission is by
quantity instead of on a percentage basis.
Thus for potatoes the commission is sometimes
10% and in other cases 4 or 5 cents a
bushel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>LIVE STOCK MARKETS</p>
</div>

<p>While poultry and game, as well as the
carcasses of the smaller animals, may be
handled through the produce markets, the
large animals require separate facilities.
The United States is noted for its large live
stock markets and for the perfection and
size of the packing houses which have
grown up about them. The most famous
example of these combined agencies is to
be found at Chicago, but important live
stock markets are also maintained at St.
Louis, Kansas City, Omaha, Pittsburgh,
Buffalo and more recently Fort Worth,
Texas. The commission charges vary from
50 cents to $1 per head for cattle and from
10 to 25 cents per head for calves, sheep and
hogs. In some markets, the commission on
hogs is 2% of the gross returns. When
located within 150 miles of a central market,
it is customary to allow 50 cents per
hundred pounds for cattle and 40 cents for
hogs to cover shrinkage, and cost of freight,
yardage, food, bedding and commission. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
is possible for an owner to sell his own live
stock in these yards, but the commission
man, because of his superior knowledge of
existing trade conditions, is almost universally
employed. Firms which handle cattle,
sheep and hogs seldom sell horses.
Although handled by different commission
firms, important horse markets are maintained
at Chicago and Buffalo immediately
adjacent to the market for meat animals. In
New York the horse markets are in a different
section of the city, that for draft and
common work horses on one street, while
the American Horse Exchange, located at
another point, handles high-class light
horses. The usual custom is to sell horses
at auction, although they may be purchased
at private treaty. In whatever manner purchased,
it is essential to understand precisely
the character of the guarantee.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>COTTON, WOOL AND TOBACCO MARKETS</p>
</div>

<p>Because of their higher value per pound
and the ease with which they can be stored,
cotton, wool and tobacco are dealt in somewhat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
differently than other farm products.
The two great cotton exchanges are located
at New Orleans and New York, the quotations
on these markets controlling the financial
transactions in cotton throughout the
world. The principal wool markets are
Boston, New York, Philadelphia and St.
Louis. The principal tobacco markets are
at Richmond and Danville, Va., Durham,
N. C., and Louisville, Ky.</p>

</div>

<p>The country shipper or the young farmer
wishing to place his products in the ordinary
channels of trade must consider and determine
among other things the following:
What cities have favorable markets for his
products; choose some commission man or
broker to handle them; calculate the expenses
for freight, commission and other
customary items; familiarize himself with
the rules for grading his products in the
market or markets under consideration; and
determine what agency there may be for
protecting him as to the weight and quality
when sales are effected. Whenever practicable,
a visit to the market in question and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
a personal study of the conditions under
which selling is done will be wise. Having
done so, and perhaps having made a number
of sales through these usual channels of
trade, he will be in a position to consider
whether he may organize to advantage some
more direct method of getting his products
to the consumer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>LAWS AFFECTING LAND AND<br />LABOR</h3>
</div>

<p>Thus far property has been treated as
invested capital upon which interest
must be charged in determining the labor
income. Labor, likewise, has been considered
principally in its effect upon profits.
Society has thrown around the transfer of
property and the use of labor certain
restraints for the protection of all individuals.</p>
<p>Through the ages certain procedures have
become fixed by custom. These legal practices
are largely the inheritance of old
Roman law and are usually known as common
law. Various legislative bodies having
jurisdiction enact from time to time
other laws. This body of enacted law is
called statute law and is much more variable
than common law. In the briefest possible
manner it is the purpose here to state a
few of the principles and applications of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
law, chiefly the common law, as it affects the
farmer in acquiring or disposing of his
property and in his dealings with labor.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>PROPERTY</p>
</div>

<p>Property may be defined as anything
which is a subject of ownership. It possesses
the characteristics of being acquired, held,
sold, willed or inherited and is of two kinds:
(1) Real property, real estate or realty; (2)
chattels or personal property. These two
kinds of property are subject to quite distinct
legal practices. In general, real estate
consists of land, things attached to it, such as
trees, buildings, fences and certain rights
and profits arising out of or annexed to the
land. The term land as ordinarily used includes
all these things, so that when land is
said to be worth so much an acre it includes
all fixtures. Ponds and streams are, under
this definition, land. The land not only has
surface dimensions, but extends upward
indefinitely and down to the center of the
earth, and hence includes a right to ores,
coal, oil, gas or other materials whatsoever.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>An article may, however, be real property
or personal property depending upon circumstances.
Thus a tree growing on the
land is real property, but when cut into cord
wood becomes personal property. New
fence posts ready for use are personal property.
When set in the ground they become
real estate. Just what goes with a farm or
what are fixtures is frequently a subject for
legal determination.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>FIXTURES</p>
</div>

<p>The general rule is that fixtures are any
chattels which have become substantially
and permanently annexed to the land or to
buildings or other things which are clearly
a part of the land.<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D"></a><a href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> The annexation may,
however, be purely theoretical, since the
keys to the house or barn, which may be in
the owners pocket, are real estate. One
rule concerning fixtures is that they must be
so annexed that they cannot be severed without
injuring the freehold. The intention of
the party making the annexation also often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
determines, since if the article is annexed
with the intention of making it permanent,
it then becomes a part of the land. Among
the things held to be fixtures, and therefore
a part of the land, are: (1) All buildings
and everything which is a part of any building,
such as doors, blinds, keys, etc.; (2)
fence materials which have been once used
and are piled up to be used again are a part
of the land, but new fence material not yet
used is personal property. (3) Growing
crops are real property. They go to the purchaser
of the land unless specially reserved
in the deed. A verbal agreement is not
sufficient. (4) Trees, if blown down or cut
down and still lying where they fell, are
real property; if cut or corded up for sale
they become personal property. (5) All
manure made on the farm is real estate and
passes with the land. (6) All the ordinary
portable machines and tools are considered
personal property, but certain machines
held to be of permanent use upon the land
are real estate. Among the things which
courts have held to go with the land are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
cotton gins, copper kettles encased in brick
and mortar for cooking food for hogs, cider
mills, pumps, water pipes bringing water
from distant springs. In general, motive
power machinery and the shafting go with
the land, but the machinery impelled may or
may not, depending upon the way it is annexed.
(7) If stones have been quarried for
the purpose of using upon the farm, they go
with the farm, but if quarried for sale they
are personal property.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>CONTRACTS</p>
</div>

<p>The difference between personal property
and real property may be indicated by
considering the essential features of a contract.
A contract is an agreement between
two or more persons. The foundation rule
concerning a contract is that every man must
fulfill every agreement he makes. An ethical
practice grows out of this legal rule
which, if strictly adhered to, will save much
embarrassment, viz., make but few promises
and always keep your engagements.</p>
<p>There are seven requirements generally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
necessary to a valid contract. (1) Possibility.
The thing to be done must be possible.
(2) Legality. It must not be forbidden by
law. (3) Proper parties. The parties to a
contract must be competent. Contracts
with idiots or drunken persons are not binding.
Some contracts with minors are not
binding, although contracts for the necessities
of life are. (4) Mutual assent. A
proposition not assented to by both parties is
not binding on either. (5) Valid consideration.
A man is not regarded as injured by
the breaking of a promise for which he has
paid, or is to pay, nothing. (6) Fraud or
deceit. A contract obtained by fraud is void
as against the party using the fraud, but may
be enforced by the innocent party if he sees
fit. (7) Written contracts. Here comes the
most important difference between real and
personal property. Real property can only
be conveyed by a written instrument, properly
executed and recorded, while personal
property passes by mere possession. Contracts
relating to the sale of real estate are
not binding unless in writing, while verbal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
contracts are sufficient for personal
property if accompanied by payment of a
part of the purchase price or the acceptance
of the goods. For amounts under $50 verbal
agreement in itself is binding.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>TRANSFER OF REAL ESTATE</p>
</div>

<p>The purchaser should require of the
seller evidence that the title to the land is
straight and clear; if not, exactly what the
defects are. This is done through an
abstract of title, which should be prepared
by a competent lawyer. This is not an official
document, and its value depends largely
upon the ability and watchfulness of the
party making the abstract. Ownership of
land is conveyed by means of a deed. A
deed is an instrument conveying at least a
life interest in the land. Care should be
taken that the deed contains the essential
parts and that it is properly executed.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>DEEDS</p>
</div>

<p>Deeds are of two kinds: Quit claim deeds,
which convey all the rights, title and interest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
which the seller has in the land, but does
not warrant the title; and warranty deeds,
which, in addition to what a quit claim
does, contain covenants which agree that the
seller and his heirs, etc., shall warrant and
defend the title to the purchaser against the
lawful claims of all persons.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>THE REQUISITES OF A DEED</p>
</div>

<p>The requisites of a deed are: The parties
to the deed, the consideration, the description;
and with a warranty deed, the covenants.
The seller must be of full age, sound
mind and if married his wife should always
join in the deed. Her name should appear
following his at the beginning of the instrument.
She should sign and acknowledge the
deed, and the certificate of acknowledgment
should state that she is the wife of the seller.
If the seller is a married woman, her husband
does not need to join in the sale of her
own property. It is customary to state the
consideration upon which the deed is given,
but this is not necessary, nor will a false
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
statement as to the amount paid invalidate
the deed.</p>
<p>The description of the land conveyed
should be as minute and careful as possible,
and preferably in the exact language of
former deeds. In case former description
is in error, it should be referred to and correct
description given. Where land is conveyed
by metes and bounds, this description
governs, although it may not convey the
number of acres of land stated. In describing
boundaries the location of monuments
takes precedence of distances mentioned.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>EXECUTION OF THE DEED</p>
</div>

<p>A deed must be signed, witnessed,
acknowledged, delivered and recorded. In
some states deeds must be sealed, but in
other states the law has dispensed with this
formality. Witnesses to deeds are not required
in all states. Some states require one,
but usually two witnesses are required. The
parties signing the deed are required to
appear before an official designated by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
statute, usually any magistrate, justice or
notary public, and acknowledge the same to
be his or her free act and deed.</p>
<p>A deed has no effect until delivered, and
should be immediately recorded by the purchaser.
Generally an unrecorded deed is
not good as against a subsequent purchaser
in good faith. It is well to note that the
laws relating to the transfer of land are
those of the place where the land lies and
not necessarily those of the place where the
deed is made.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>METHOD OF LAYING OUT PUBLIC LANDS</p>
</div>

<p>The public lands of the United States are,
whenever practicable, laid out into townships
each six miles square, as near as may
be, whose sides run due north and south
and east and west. The townships are laid
off north and south of a base line which is
a parallel of latitude, and are numbered
north and south from the base line: Thus,
T. 3 S., means Township No. 3 south from
the base line. Each row of townships running
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
north and south is called a range, and
is numbered east or west of the principal
meridian: Thus, R. 2 E., means Range 2
east of the given meridian.</p>
<p>The townships are then laid off into sections
or square miles of 640 acres, as near
as may be, and these are numbered, beginning
always at the northeast section, as
shown in the accompanying diagram.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g0016.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 500px; height: 454px;' /><br />
</div>

<p>Each quarter section is referred to as the
northeast or southwest quarter of the section,
and each forty acres as the northwest or
southeast quarter of a particular quarter.
For example, an eighty-acre field may be
referred to as the west half of the southwest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
quarter of Section 3, Township 5 North,
Range 3, west of &mdash;&mdash;. Base line
and meridian, or in some cases merely the
meridian is mentioned.</p>
<p>The curvature of the earths surface makes
it impossible for the sides of townships
to be truly north and south and at the same
time six miles square. The excesses and the
deficiencies due to the convergency of meridians
and the curvature of the earth are by
law added to or deducted from the western
and northern ranges of sections and half
sections of the townships. While the above
has been the rule in laying out public lands
for more than a century, there are many exceptions,
due to many causes.</p>
<p>In the older settled sections the land was
laid out in lots, often in a very irregular
manner, although in some cases within a
given tract the area was more or less regular.
In these cases, the land must be described
minutely and carefully by metes and
bounds. In some of the southern and western
states, also, where there were Spanish
grants, much irregularity in the surveys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
exists. Over much of the north Central
states this rectangular system of laying out
lands obtains and has worked well in most
respects.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>THE LANDLORD AND TENANT</p>
</div>

<p>Leases of real estate follow the same procedure
as deeds, except that a verbal lease,
if for a term of not to exceed one year, is
valid in most states. A written lease should
be carefully drawn, because, according to
common law, there are few things implied
in a lease that are not stated. Definite statement
concerning repairs and insurance is
desirable. A tenant should also acquaint
himself with the law of the state concerning
the surrender of the farm upon the expiration
of his term.</p>
<p>It is the duty of the tenant not only to
guard the property, but to conduct the farm
in a husbandlike manner. Unless otherwise
stated in the contract, the tenant must pursue
those methods of husbandry which are
customary in the vicinity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>THE RELATION OF THE FARMER TO HIS</p>
<p>WORKMEN</p>
</div>

<p>The requirements of a valid contract, as
previously stated, control most of the relations
which the employer has with his employees.
Contracts for labor, unless for
more than one year, need not be in writing.
If, however, the service to be rendered is
unusual, the agreement should be reduced to
writing, because, in the absence of specific
agreement, the law assumes that customary
service and wages are implied.</p>
<p>Like all other employers of labor the
farmer is under obligation to protect his
workman from injury. He must not subject
them to unusual and unreasonable risks.
He must hire workmen suited to the employment.
For example, if he employs a
young boy to drive a fractious horse, he
would be liable for any injury that might
occur. In like manner, he must exercise
proper care concerning the safety of the
machinery placed in the hands of his workmen.
He must keep his premises in a safe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
condition and must not expose his workmen
to risks not incident to the employment for
which they are hired.</p>
<p>The farmer is liable in damages for the
acts of his workmen which are within the
scope of their employment, although the
authority may not have been expressly conferred.
He who acts by another acts himself.
In case one is sued for the acts of his
employee, the burden is upon him to prove
that the act of the workman was without
authority, expressed or implied.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>RURAL LEGISLATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Various laws have been enacted by
federal and state legislatures for the
better protection of producer and consumer.
Much of this legislation affects in a very
special way the interests of the farmer. Not
infrequently, in fact, generally, the state
department of agriculture has more or less
direct jurisdiction over their enforcement.
State departments of agriculture usually
publish a collection of the laws of this character.
These laws vary greatly in the different
states and only the most general outline,
as they affect the interests of the farmer, can
be given here. Persons can inform themselves
as to the details as enforced in a given
state by applying to the state secretary of
agriculture.</p>
<p>A number of these acts affect interstate
commerce, concerning which the United
States Constitution says: No state shall,
without the consent of the Congress, lay any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
impost or duties on imports or exports, except
what may be absolutely necessary for
executing its inspection laws. By a series
of judicial decisions it has been determined
that a State has a right to enforce laws
affecting interstate commerce when traffic
in the articles thus modified or prohibited
affects the public welfare. When it is necessary
to have a police regulation to prevent
fraud in the traffic of an article or for the
purpose of guarding the public health or
morals, police laws, so called, may be enacted
and enforced. Around this general
question there has waged a bitter controversy
which has occupied some of the best
legal minds and is one involving some difficulty.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>FERTILIZER CONTROL</p>
</div>

<p>One of the first of the control measures
to be enacted, and the one which has been
most universally adopted by the several
states, is the law requiring the manufacturer
and dealer in commercial fertilizers to guarantee
the percentage of the so-called essential
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
fertilizing elements&mdash;nitrogen, phosphorus
and potassium&mdash;contained in each
bag of fertilizer offered for sale. Subsequent
control laws have been modeled more
or less closely after this law. Hence a description
of the operation and execution of
it will serve for all.</p>
<p>The execution of this law is usually under
the immediate supervision of the state secretary
of agriculture, while the necessary
chemical analyses are made by the state
experiment station. In some states the enforcement
of the law is in charge of the state
experiment station, while in others the state
department of agriculture has its own laboratories
or employs a private chemist. It is,
however, becoming a more and more settled
policy to place all police regulations in
charge of the state department of agriculture,
while at the same time the chemical
analyses and other scientific and technological
inquiries are made at the state experiment
station.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the taking of samples
and in order to raise funds for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
execution of the law, the manufacturer is
required to take out a license and to make a
statement of the brands of fertilizers which
he will place upon the market in the given
state during the given season.</p>
<p>During the spring and fall season agents
traverse the state and sample the bags of
fertilizers as found on sale by local merchants.
The samples are sent by number
under seal to the designated chemist, while
at the same time the agent transmits to the
state officer in charge of the enforcement of
the law the necessary information concerning
these samples. Upon the receipt of the
analysis made by the chemist, who has had
no knowledge of the origin of the sample,
the state officer compares them with the
guarantee of the manufacturer, and if he
finds it necessary enters legal complaint.
While these laws have been in force for
many years in some states and in many states
for some years, prosecution has seldom been
found necessary. The honest manufacturer
is protected from dishonest competition, and
the dishonest manufacturer, if there be such,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
cannot afford the publicity which noncompliance
with the law would entail.</p>
<p>It has been customary to publish, with the
results of analysis, also an estimate of the
commercial value per ton of each brand of
fertilizer. This estimated commercial value
is obtained by multiplying the pounds of
each element or combinations of the element
in a ton by a value per pound. To the value
of the fertilizer thus obtained is added something
for cost of mixing, bagging
and freight, and something for profit.
The price per pound given to each
element or combinations of the elements
is based upon the commercial value of
the element when purchased in raw materials.
The price for each year is usually
determined by a conference of those in control
of the execution of the law in the several
states for certain groups of states. As
a matter of fact, the price varies little from
year to year.</p>
<p>The published figures, therefore, constitute
a table of comparative commercial
values as determined by the most expert
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
knowledge. While not constituting a statement
of absolute commercial value for any
given locality, they do enable the purchaser
to determine whether the price quoted on a
given brand of fertilizer is within reason.
Persons who are unacquainted with the
principles controlling the use of commercial
fertilizers may, however, be led to believe
that the price of the fertilizer is an indication
of its value for the production of a
given crop. As is well known to all students
of the subject, there is no necessary
relation between the commercial value of a
fertilizer and the fitness of its formula for
a given soil and crop. For these and other
reasons, the publication of tables of commercial
value has been strongly opposed by
some manufacturers, and in certain states
the custom has been discontinued. While
granting that tables of commercial value are
subject to misinterpretation, it is perhaps
fair to say that such tables have been of most
benefit, and, moreover, have been of great
value to those who were most likely to misinterpret
them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>It has been customary in most states to
make analyses only of mixed fertilizers.
Thus such raw materials as nitrate of soda,
sulphate of ammonia, dried blood, bone
meal, rock phosphate, tankage, muriate of
potash, sulphate of potash, have not been
brought under the operation of the law. If
one wishes to purchase nitrate of soda,
muriate of potash and tankage with the intention
of mixing them according to a
formula of his own, he may not find any
protection in his state. However, these products
can be obtained through reputable
dealers who will willingly guarantee the
contents. In case of doubt, the purchaser
may secure an analysis by his state experiment
station at a moderate cost.</p>
<p>The law requires that there shall be
affixed to every package of fertilizer offered
for sale a statement about as follows:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>The minimum per centum of each of the following
constituents which may be contained therein:</p>
<p>(a) Nitrogen.</p>
<p>(b) Soluble, available and total phosphoric acid,
except in cases of undissolved bone, basic slag phosphate,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
wood ashes, unheated phosphate rock, garbage tankage
and pulverized natural manures, when the minimum
per centum of total phosphoric acid may be substituted.
This latter applies only in those states where raw materials
are subject to inspection.</p>
<p>(c) Potash soluble in distilled water.</p>
</div>
<p>It is possible to comply with the law and
yet state the guarantee upon each bag of
fertilizer in such a manner as to mislead the
uninformed. It is not the purpose of this
book to deal with such technical details, but
if the purchaser of commercial fertilizers is
not already well acquainted with fertilizer
terms, he should secure an elementary textbook
on the subject or write to his state experiment
station for a bulletin discussing
them.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>FEEDING STUFF CONTROL</p>
</div>

<p>The law controlling the sale of stock foods
is of more recent origin than the fertilizer
control act and has not been so universally
adopted up to the present time. The necessity
for such a law arises from the growing
use as stock foods of various by-products in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
the manufacture of liquors, starch, glucose,
sugar, cottonseed and linseed oils and breakfast
foods. Various mixtures, varying
widely in chemical composition, especially
in protein and crude fiber, were placed upon
the market. In some instances mixtures
were grossly adulterated with such things
as oat hulls and ground corn cobs.</p>
<p>The adoption of this law by certain states
has served to make other states the dumping
ground for inferior stock foods, thus
increasing the necessity for similar protection.
The law does not apply to the ordinary
grains produced by farmers or to the
usual by-products of millers.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>SEED CONTROL</p>
</div>

<p>From time immemorial it has been the
universal custom of seedsmen to disclaim all
responsibility for the purity and germinating
power of their seeds. But as the importance
of good seed&mdash;good in hereditary
power, good in germination, good in its freedom
from adulteration, good in its absence
of noxious weed seed&mdash;has become better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
understood demand for some method of control
has arisen. In at least one state there is
a seed-control law modeled quite closely
after the fertilizer-control law. However,
the usual method of protection consists in
purchasing by sample or the insistence of a
guarantee, with a subsequent analysis of
a sample of the purchased seed.</p>
<p>The germinating power and purity of
seed can be determined cheaply by an expert
within from five to twenty days, depending
upon the species. The federal government
has a division of seed control in its
Department of Agriculture at Washington,
D. C. Any person may send a sample of seed
to this division and have its purity and
germinating power determined, and in some
of the states the experiment station will
perform similar services without charge.
Clover, alfalfa, grass and other small seeds
should always be purchased subject to such
inspection, unless the purchaser is prepared
to make his own inspection, which a very
little training makes possible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>NURSERY INSPECTION</p>
</div>

<p>There is no national law concerning the
importation of insect-infested or diseased
plant stock.</p>
<p>Several of the states have passed both
state and interstate regulations concerning
the sale of nursery stock. The insects usually
legislated against are San Jose scale,
gypsy moth and brown-tail moth, while the
diseases usually interdicted are yellows,
black knot, peach rosette, and pear blight.</p>
<p>The enforcement of the law is usually
placed in charge of a person having special
knowledge of economic insects and fungous
diseases. In addition to these police regulations
this officer may, by various means,
attempt to bring into practice methods calculated
to eradicate or, at least, lessen the
severity of existing attacks.</p>
<p>Commerce in vinegar, dried fruits, insecticides
and fungicides is also regulated in
some states.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>DAIRY, FOOD AND DRUG INSPECTION</p>
</div>

<p>An adequate discussion of the rise and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
development of the control in the sale of
dairy and food products would require a
chapter by itself, if not an entire volume.
Suffice it to say here that the laws on this
general subject have acquired an importance
in many ways quite beyond that of any
of the other control measures discussed in
this chapter. In the extent of funds handled,
the number of agents employed and the public
interest incited, the office of dairy and
food commissioner outranks any other control
agency. In some states the office is an
elective one, and the questions with which
the office has to deal become a part of the
state political campaign.</p>
<p>The importance of the inspection of dairy
and food products grows out of the fact that
not only is the consumer, hence all the
world, interested, but the execution of these
laws touch large commercial interests. Not
only are meat packers, distillers and brewers
deeply interested, but the wholesale and
retail grocers and, more recently, the manufacturing
and prescribing druggists, are
vitally concerned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>Not many years ago the inspection of
dairy products, particularly control of the
traffic in oleomargarine, was the chief function
of this office. To-day the enforcement
of laws concerning pure foods, liquor and
drugs is of much greater importance.</p>
<p>Interstate commerce in oleomargarine is
now regulated through the enactment of an
internal revenue law requiring a tax of ten
cents a pound on colored oleomargarine
and one-fourth of a cent a pound
on uncolored oleomargarine and, further,
by prescribing the character of
package and method of marking all oleomargarine
entering into interstate commerce.
State agencies are charged with the
duty of requiring the compliance of local
dealers and restaurateurs with the general
features of the federal law. Some states,
however, prohibit entirely the sale of colored
oleomargarine within the state.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>PURITY IN DAIRY PRODUCTS</p>
</div>

<p>Attempts to define what is pure milk,
cream, butter or cheese have been fraught
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
with much difficulty. Thus, for example,
legal definitions of pure milk have resulted
in some cows giving illegal milk. In some
instances the law has declared simply that
whole milk is milk from which no cream
has been removed; in others, the minimum
amount of butter fat has been prescribed; in
still others, the minimum amount of total
solids containing a minimum proportion of
butter fat has been made the basis of legal
milk. In like manner full cream cheese
has been defined as cheese made from whole
milk or from milk from which only a given
amount of cream has been removed, while
in other instances the minimum amount of
butter fat which full cream cheese may contain
is prescribed. The wide variation in
the amount of butter fat carried by cream
has caused much jocular comment and some
serious discussion as to what is cream.</p>
<p>While it is not feasible to indicate the
laws for the several states, the ruling of the
federal government as to what constitutes
purity in dairy products under the national
food and drug act may be accepted as a general
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
guide. A circular giving the required
information may be secured by addressing
the Secretary of Agriculture, Washington,
D. C.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>LIVE STOCK SANITATION</p>
</div>

<p>The control of contagious diseases in
domestic animals and the inspection of meat
products have been the chief work of the
Bureau of Animal Industry of the United
States Department of Agriculture since its
establishment.</p>
<p>The bureau inspects all imported live animals
and under certain conditions will
inspect live animals intended for exportation.
It inspects all meat products intended
for export. Its inspection of meats intended
for interstate commerce is less rigid than
that exported. Meats sold within the state
in which they are slaughtered cannot be
required by the federal government to undergo
inspection. It thus happens that the
people of the several states enjoy less protection
in the consumption of meat than the
foreign purchaser of American meats unless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
there is a state meat inspection law. However,
it is becoming more and more the
custom for the large packers to have all
their products inspected without regard to
their destination. The meats slaughtered in
the locality in which they are consumed are
the ones that receive the least supervision.</p>
<p>The federal government has been especially
active and efficient in the prevention
of interstate commerce in cattle suffering
with Texas fever, and sheep attacked with
scab and foot rot. Through the agency of
the bureau dipping tanks have been provided
in all the great live stock markets for
the disinfection of cattle and sheep when
needed.</p>
<p>Several of the states have laws controlling
the importation of diseased animals from
other states and the transfer of them within
the state. The following are the diseases
most commonly mentioned in the laws of the
several states: Anthrax, black quarter, hog
cholera, swine plague, rabies, glanders and
tuberculosis. The law is generally enforced
by a state veterinarian, whose acts are supervised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
either by a state live stock commission
or the state secretary of agriculture or these
two agencies acting conjointly.</p>
<p>Perhaps the disease which has required
the greatest amount of attention in the several
states is tuberculosis in milch cows. It
is customary for this office to apply the
tuberculin test, free of charge, under certain
stipulations, to any herd upon the
request of the owner and to supervise the
slaughter and disposition of the reacting
animals. In some states the owner is indemnified
in part or in whole for his loss. The
amount of indemnity as well as the general
features of the law concerning the control
of tuberculosis in domestic animals has been
the subject of much controversy and cannot
be said to have reached an altogether satisfactory
solution in most states.</p>
<p>The young farmer should clearly understand
that under no circumstances can he
afford to have a tuberculous animal in his
herd. The contact of a diseased animal
with other animals of the herd is certain to
entail a greater loss than the destruction of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
the diseased animal. The farmer must in
his own interest rear healthy animals
whether or not it is necessary for the protection
of the consumer.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>FISH AND GAME LAWS</p>
</div>

<p>The motives underlying the enactment of
laws concerning fish and game are varied.
The controversies over these laws in the legislatures
of the several states indicate that
there is a belief, whatever may be the fact,
that there are opposing interests; viz., those
of the hunter or sportsman on the one hand,
and those of the farmer or landowner on the
other. The law of trespass has been one
over which has raged much bitterness, both
with regard to the form of the law to be
enacted and concerning its subsequent enforcement.
Sportsmen have usually held
that a distinction existed between wild animals
occupying private property and
domestic animals. The landowner has
urged that others should not trespass upon
his property for the purpose of shooting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
wild animals, although his proprietary right
in them was no greater.</p>
<p>In like manner, laws concerning the
closed season, made to protect animals during
the breeding period, are the subject of
extended discussion and are being constantly
changed; both because there is a
difference of opinion concerning the habits
of the different species and because the motive
varies for maintaining the supply. Some
animals are protected on account of their
benefit, supposed or real, to agriculture.
Other animals are protected because of
their gaming qualities, even to the extent
of sometimes injuring farm crops. The
money spent by sportsmen in the pursuit
of game is an element in the varied interests
involved. Humane motives and a
desire to prevent the further restriction of a
not too varied fauna have helped, also, to
save certain species from extinction. On
the other hand, in some states commercial
interests are involved, as where large quantities
of birds are taken for their plumage.</p>
<p>Some attempts have been made to introduce
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
foreign species, as the Japanese pheasant.
It is, however, with fish that the most
has been accomplished in replenishment.
The federal government and several of the
states have been active in regularly restocking,
each season, certain streams with fry
of edible and game fish.</p>
<p>Information concerning the open season
can be obtained from the proper state
officer. The fish and game laws are usually
under the control of a commission with a
secretary as the executive officer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>RURAL FORCES</h3>
</div>

<p>The United States is a vast domain. Its
material resources are enormous. Its
fertile and easily tilled soil, its magnificent
forests, its great stores of ore, coal, oil and
gas; its fine water-power sites and its temperate
and healthful climate have all contributed
to the making of a prosperous and
progressive nation. Without these natural
resources the United States could not be
what it is.</p>
<p>The waste of some of these resources is
almost beyond belief. In mining, one-half
the anthracite and one-third the soft coal is
left in the ground in such a manner that it
may never be economically recovered. A
ton of coal will produce 1,400 pounds of
coke, worth $1.50, and 20 pounds of sulphate
of ammonia, worth 50 cents. If all
the nitrogen in coal which is turned into
coke in Pennsylvania were recovered, it
would furnish enough of this element to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
supply the needs of every acre of tillable
soil in that state. Only about 44% of the
wood in the trees now harvested in the
United States is incorporated into buildings,
apparatus and furniture. The rest is wasted
in the process of cutting, sawing and manufacturing
into the finished products.</p>
<p>Facts like these have led the nation to
realize that the conservation of our natural
resources is an immediate and pressing
problem. The United States has, however,
a greater inheritance than these great and
beneficent gifts of nature and a more fundamental
problem than the preservation and
efficient use of them. In a single sentence,
the greatest inheritance of the American
people is their Puritan ancestry. The word
Puritan is here used to apply not only to the
New England Pilgrims, but to all our early
forefathers, whose traditions and practices
have served to set this country apart from
the other countries of the world. Because
of the traditions which have been handed
down to us, we are healthier-bodied and
cleaner-minded men and women. We are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
more efficient, not merely in making money,
but in everything that goes to make a full
and well-rounded life.</p>
<p>It is well to realize the resources of other
nations. The agricultural possibilities of
France appear to the casual observer to compare
favorably with any equal area in the
United States. One may see farm land in
Italy which has been cultivated for at least
two thousand years which is evidently as
fertile as any of the limestone valleys of the
Atlantic States, the prairies of the Mississippi
valley or the Palouse district of the
Northwest. Russia has enormous areas of
fertile soil. Careful observers report that
in Manchuria there are great stretches of
country, which today possess natural opportunities
similar to those which the Mississippi
valley offered one hundred years ago.
The recent stories of the deposits of coal and
mineral wealth in China are almost fabulous.
Europe has rich mines, great forests
and unrivaled water-power.</p>
<p>Some years ago a native of Argentina and
a native of the United States were dining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
together. The Argentinian had served his
government as consul to Canada. He
related that he had recently written an official
letter in which he had occasion to refer
to the people of Canada and to those of
this country. He explained that in alluding
to the former he could say the Canadians,
but the latter he could not call Americans,
since his people were also Americans.
After due consideration he referred to us as
the Yankees. But, turning to his
hearer, he said, with great emphasis, I do
not look upon the people of the United
States as a nation, but as a new civilization.
In other words, our nation is not simply one
of fertile farms, enormous mines, great forests,
unparalleled railroad systems, palatial
stores, or wealthy cities, but he saw that we
are a people of different economic, political,
educational, social, moral and religious
ideals.</p>
<p>There are in every rural neighborhood
certain forces whose objects are to increase
the educational advantages, the social
opportunities and the moral aspirations of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
the people. This subject need not be discussed
merely in the abstract. There are
in every community concrete evidences of
these forces. There is the rural church.
There is the rural school. In many localities
are to be found, also, buildings, for
social and fraternal purposes, as grange
halls, structures for holding fairs and picnics.
These are tangible evidences that
there are rural agencies at work in the community
whose chief purpose is to increase
the educational advantages, the social
opportunities and the moral aspirations of
the people.</p>
<p>How are these existing rural forces to be
made more effective? If co-operation in
financial affairs is essential under modern
conditions, it is more needed in social matters.
Such co-operation does not imply that
these separate forces shall be fused into a
single one. Each of them has its particular
and peculiar work to do, but each should
work in harmony and not in the spirit of
antagonism with the others.</p>
<p>There should be formed in each locality
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
a committee for which the following name
is proposed: The Community Committee of
Rural Forces. Emphasis should be placed
upon the word community. Like all
moral movements, progress must come from
within, and not from without. The movement
must be adapted to its environment.
Like the plants that grow there, it must be
indigenous to the soil.</p>

Mr. Lowell B. Gable, Glen Gable Farms, Wybrooke, Pa., a graduate of Cornell University, is developing 812 acres of land in Chester county. He has a herd of 80 Guernsey cows in milk and is breeding Percheron, registered polling horses and Chester White hogs. Mr. Gable has been supervisor of the township for two years, during which time nine and one-half miles of macadam road have been built without materially increasing the taxes. Mr. Gable firmly believes that one of the best opportunities to be of help to a rural community lies in the work to be done for the improvement of social conditions&mdash;to help make what little leisure there is clean and refreshing. Hence on return from college he played baseball and football with local teams and helped out at every opportunity at dances, musicales and other social entertainments.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>This committee should be composed of
representatives of the churches, the schools,
farmers clubs, granges, fair associations,
farmers institutes; and other organizations
which are striving to increase the educational
advantages, the social opportunities
and the moral aspirations of the people.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the object of these rural forces
is confused with efforts to increase the financial
prosperity of the farmer. It goes without
saying that the maintenance of the
fertility of the soil is essential to the food
supply of the nation. The problems of the
economic production of plants and animals
are of great importance to the prosperity of
the farmer. The idea, however, that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
proper solution of these economic problems
is to be the means of solving the educational,
social and religious problems is simply
putting the cart before the horse. Economic
questions can only be satisfactorily adjusted
through the application of intelligence and
right ideas.</p>
<p>Let it be supposed that when a young man
decides to pay attention to a young woman
that instead of meeting her at the church
door, or it may be at the railway station, it is
considered better form for him to get permission
of the mother to call upon the
young woman in her own home. This is the
most fundamental question in every neighborhood.
What has it to do with the price
of wheat?</p>
<p>This illustration has been used to emphasize
two points. First, there are many problems
in every community that are in no way
related to the material prosperity of the
neighborhood. Second, there is, at present,
no single force in the community with sufficient
influence to cope properly with many
of these problems.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>A young college graduate who is now
managing eight hundred acres of land
recently wrote: I firmly believe that one of
the best opportunities to be of help to a rural
community lies in the work that is to be
done for the improvement of social conditions&mdash;to
help make what little leisure there
is clean and refreshing. Hence on return
from college this young man has found
time to play football and baseball with local
teams and to help whenever opportunity
offered at dances, musicales and similar entertainments.
Games and other forms of
recreation may be clean and wholesome, or
they may be quite the reverse. It would be
the duty of the community committee to see
that dances occurred under proper environment&mdash;not
next an open saloon&mdash;and that
the young women were properly chaperoned.</p>
<p>In many communities the boys and girls
are almost wholly dependent upon the
neighboring towns for their amusement.
This condition may or may not be desirable.
If the town and country are virtually one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
community, there is every reason why the
boys and girls from the farms should find
recreation and social intercourse with the
boys and girls of the village. It is a relationship
that should be fostered wherever
possible. When, however, the town and
the country are separate communities, which
prevent the ordinary social relationships, it
is usually unfortunate when the young people
of the one community are dependent
upon the other community for their amusements.</p>
<p>A deeply earnest man recently said: I
was born and raised upon the farm. I never
knew a dull day in my life. I went fishing.
I went hunting and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Stop right there, said the listener.
There is not the same opportunity today
for a boy to go hunting that there was when
you were a boy.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>Our ideas about such things have
changed, also.</p>
<p>Yes, he replied, humbly enough, for he
was a man of fine fiber.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>I propose a substitute, said the listener.
There is much more pleasure and recreation
to be obtained from photographing animals
than from killing them. What is
needed in every rural community is a
camera club.</p>
<p>When a boy wishes to go hunting, he
merely has to buckle on his ammunition
pouch, shoulder his gun and he is ready. A
camera club, however, requires a social
organization and a social center. The community
committee would thus be required
to decide whether the facilities for developing
and printing pictures may best be
located at the church, the schoolhouse, the
grange hall or elsewhere.</p>
<p>A little reflection will show how many
possibilities such a club might have on its
social, moral and educational side. The
suggestion has been made here, however,
only as an illustration of the problems which
arise when a rural community is organized
for social welfare. The organization of a
book club, or a magazine club in a rural
community presents precisely the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
problems. Some method must be devised
for exchanging the books or magazines.
Whether they are exchanged at the church,
the grange hall or through the school children
will depend upon local conditions
requiring a community committee to decide.</p>
<p>This community committee will do something
more than reach immediate results.
It may project its influence far into the
future. Not all of life is comprised in a
porcelain bathtub and nickel adornments.
Nevertheless modern methods of heating
and plumbing are desirable in the country
as well as in the city. In Indiana there is
a one-room school building. In the basement
there has been placed a furnace and
a gasoline engine. The engine is used not
only to teach the boys how to run a gasoline
engine, but it makes possible a modern system
of plumbing.</p>
<p>It is well known that many of the states
within the past decade have voted to abolish
or very materially restrict the sale of alcoholic
beverages. No great temperance orators
have roused the people as was the case
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
thirty years or more ago. Why, then, has
such progress been made in recent years?
In large part because twenty-five years ago,
the teaching of physiology was introduced
into the public schools, which taught the
evil effects of alcohol to the human system.
During the past decade young men who
studied these physiologies have been voting.</p>
<p>What has the teaching of physiology to
do with the one-room schoolhouse in Indiana
with its modern system of plumbing?
The girls between the ages of six and fourteen
are now becoming accustomed to modern
systems of plumbing. When they grow
older and marry they will find some way to
introduce similar conveniences into their
homes without regard to the price of wheat.
A wise community committee will find
many ways to influence future generations.
Such a committee would be a priceless
heritage to any community.</p>
<p>The natural resources of the United
States are necessary to the prosperity of the
people. The preservation and economic
use of these resources are of vast importance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
The natural resources of the world were,
however, as great five thousand years ago
as they are today. The soil was no less fertile
then than now. The difference between
the prosperity of the human race at these
two periods is caused by a difference in
human motive and efficiency. It is the result
of ideals and knowledge. Sit at the banquet
table with men who are the real powers in
shaping the affairs of the world. The
chances are that the champagne remains untouched.
These men are not in the habit of
partaking of midnight suppers. They must
keep themselves fit for the next days work.
They have the approval and loyalty of their
wives because they deserve it. In other
words, the men who do the worlds work are
not drunkards. They are not gluttons. They
are not libertines. They are efficient
because they have healthy bodies and clean
minds. It is this efficiency which the critic
from Argentina saw when he said, I do not
look upon the people of the United States
as a nation, but as a new civilization.

<p><b>First Principles of Soil Fertility</b></p>
<p>By <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Alfred Vivian</span>. There is no subject of more vital
importance to the farmer than that of the best method
of maintaining the fertility of the soil. The very evident
decrease in the fertility of those soils which have been
under cultivation for a number of years, combined with
the increased competition and the advanced price of labor,
have convinced the intelligent farmer that the agriculture
of the future must be based upon more rational practices
than those which have been followed in the past. We
have felt for some time that there was a place for a
brief, and at the same time comprehensive, treatise on
this important subject of Soil Fertility. Professor Vivians
experience as a teacher in the short winter courses has
admirably fitted him to present this matter in a popular
style. In this little book he has given the gist of the
subject in plain language, practically devoid of technical
and scientific terms. It is pre-eminently a First Book,
and will be found especially valuable to those who desire
an introduction to the subject, and who intend to do subsequent
reading. Illustrated. 5x7 inches. 265 pages. Cloth.</p>

<p><b>The Study of Corn</b></p>
<p>By <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Prof. V. M. Shoesmith</span>. A most helpful book to all
farmers and students interested in the selection and improvement
of corn. It is profusely illustrated from photographs,
all of which carry their own story and contribute
their part in making pictures and text matter a clear, concise
and interesting study of corn. Illustrated. 5x7 inches.

<p><b>Profitable Stock Raising</b></p>
<p>By <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Clarence A. Shamel</span>. This book covers fully the
principles of breeding and feeding for both fat stock and
dairying type. It tells of sheep and mutton raising, hot
house lambs, the swine industry and the horse market.
Finally, he tells of the preparation of stock for the market
and how to prepare it so that it will bring a high market
price. Live stock is the most important feature of farm
life, and statistics show a production far short of the
actual requirements. There are many problems to be
faced in the profitable production of stock, and these are
fully and comprehensively covered in Mr. Shamels new
book. Illustrated. 5x7 inches. 288 pages. Cloth.</p>

<p><b>The Business of Dairying</b></p>
<p>By <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>C. B. Lane</span>. The author of this practical little book
is to be congratulated on the successful manner in which
he has treated so important a subject. It has been prepared
for the use of dairy students, producers and handlers
of milk, and all who make dairying a business. Its purpose
is to present in a clear and concise manner various
business methods and systems which will help the dairyman
to reap greater profits. This book meets the needs
of the average dairy farmer, and if carefully followed will
lead to successful dairying. It may also be used as an
elementary textbook for colleges, and especially in short-course
classes. Illustrated. 5x7 inches. 300 pages. Cloth.</p>

<p><b>Questions and Answers on Buttermaking</b></p>
<p>By <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Chas A. Publow</span>. This book is entirely different
from the usual type of dairy books, and is undoubtedly in
a class by itself. The entire subject of butter-making in
all its branches has been most thoroughly treated, and
many new and important features have been added. The
tests for moisture, salt and acid have received special
attention, as have also the questions on cream separation,
pasteurization, commercial starters, cream ripening,
cream overrun, marketing of butter, and creamery management.

<p><b>Questions and Answers on Milk and Milk Testing</b></p>
<p>By <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Chas. A. Publow</span>, and <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Hugh C. Troy</span>. A book that
no student in the dairy industry can afford to be without.
No other treatise of its kind is available, and no book of
its size gives so much practical and useful information in
the study of milk and milk products. Illustrated. 5x7

<p><b>Soils</b></p>
<p>By <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Charles William Burkett</span>, Director Kansas Agricultural
Experiment Station. The most complete and
popular work of the kind ever published. As a rule, a
book of this sort is dry and uninteresting, but in this case
it reads like a novel. The author has put into it his individuality.
The story of the properties of the soils, their
improvement and management, as well as a discussion of
the problems of crop growing and crop feeding, make this
book equally valuable to the farmer, student and teacher.
Illustrated. 303 pages. 5-1/2x8 inches. Cloth.   Net, $1.25</p>
<p><b>Weeds of the Farm Garden</b></p>
<p>By <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>L. H. Pammel</span>. The enormous losses, amounting
to several hundred million dollars annually in the United
States, caused by weeds stimulate us to adopt a better
system of agriculture. The weed question is, therefore,
a most important and vital one for American farmers.
This treatise will enable the farmer to treat his field to
remove weeds. The book is profusely illustrated by photographs
and drawings made expressly for this work, and
will prove invaluable to every farmer, land owner, gardener
and park superintendent. 5x7 inches. 300 pages.

<p><b>Farm Machinery and Farm Motors</b></p>
<p>By <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>J. B. Davidson</span> and <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>L. W. Chase</span>. Farm Machinery
and Farm Motors is the first American book published
on the subject of Farm Machinery since that written by
J. J. Thomas in 1867. This was before the development
of many of the more important farm machines, and the
general application of power to the work of the farm.
Modern farm machinery is indispensable in present-day
farming operations, and a practical book like Farm Machinery
and Farm Motors will fill a much-felt need. The
book has been written from lectures used by the authors
before their classes for several years, and which were prepared
from practical experience and a thorough review of
the literature pertaining to the subject. Although written
primarily as a textbook, it is equally useful for the practical
farmer. Profusely illustrated. 5-1/2x8 inches. 520
pages. Cloth.</p>

of a student of economic as well as agricultural conditions,
well fitted by the broad experience in both practical
and theoretical lines to tell the whole story in a condensed
form. It is designed for the farmer, the teacher, and the
student as well. Illustrated. 5-1/2x8 inches. 370 pages.
